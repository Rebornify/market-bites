        "selftext": "I'm sure some of you, like me, follow WSB and other places, if for nothing more than entertainment. It got me thinking about Gamestop today. I'm mildly annoyed with myself that I didn't do the legwork to understand it when I looked at it in 2019. Being the lazy person I am I saw eh, weak/negative earnings history, outdated business model, and didn't put any more effort into it. I typically don't pay any attention to short percentages. The concepts in play aren't especially hard to understand, and when at that time it was in the $2-5 range it was not unreasonable to think it had a lot more upside than downside, especially with the console cycle coming, even without the benefit of the short pressure.\n\nI'm not much into these kinda of asymmetric longshots with potentially huge upsides, because they tend to get into distributions, probabilities, long-tails, the weakness in black-scholes, all that jazz. I get it on a macro concept level but my math skills revolt and my brain ends up saying too hard, too easy for you to be wrong, leave it alone. Looking back when Gamestop was at $2 with the balance sheet strength it had left and the amount it was shorted at the time, this was a real wide-margin intelligent speculation. A speculation, but one with heaps of implied upside. Whether I could have held on throughout the unknowns of the pandemic, I don't know. And if congress hadn't acted or the fed acted differently, who knows. The outcome could have been very different.\n\nBut now is a very different story. The stock isn't $2 anymore, it's $100 or $200, depending which minute of the day your ticker updates. The proposition has changed, not just for the next speculator looking to buy in, but every earlier speculator who already took a position.\n\nSo what's a person to do who did take a flyer and gamble on it, or recognized the opportunity early and levied an intelligent speculation? How do you decide when it's time to cash your golden ticket and call your accountant. This is a classic prisoner's dilemma. Assuming the float reported is still accurate, and there is more than 100% of the outstanding shares sold short, then naked short selling has occurred and the short positions are really in the ditch. Last report I read, shorts borrowed several billion dollars to meet margin requirements and pray the GME holders flinch soon. \n\nLogically there has to be a ceiling, some price at which the last dollar is be extracted from the richest short seller, after which their lender of last resort has refused, and the bankruptcy's begin. Price appreciation beyond this is simply the greater fool chasing a story. I don't think there's a way to determine this empirically, since even if you could get all the necessary numbers and guarantee they were accurate, and you could nail down appropriate probabilities and the accompanying profit margins from each scenario, this involves not only a lot of human psychology but a good deal of politics, propaganda, lawyerly wrangling and the potential for backroom dealings. Not exactly the stuff of certainty or traditional value investing, but fascinating (to me, at least) as a spectator. This is a prisoner's dilemma.\n\nEvery person who now owns GME long is a prisoner, and every short seller is a prison guard. As long as the prisoners stick together, up to the limit of bankrupting the collective short sellers the squeeze should continue and increase the collective payout. But as soon as the guards are able to flip a big enough holder or enough small holders to knock over that first domino, the formula tips and the second domino caves in, and so on down the line. This is the basis of the theory Malcolm Gladwell outlined in The Tipping Point. So each holder has to consider his or her own selfish interest of cashing out now before that occurs, versus the risk/reward of betting that the group isn't going to tip yet and staying in for a greater amount of price pressure upward, hoping they aren't left to catch a falling knife later.\n\nWhen is it going to tip, at what price, and how much yoyo action might occur in the meantime, before the final short is settled. I wouldn't even pretend to try and model this. That's Nassim Taleb territory, higher probability mathematics. I'd be fascinated to read about it, but not my bag.\n\nIt did get me thinking about options. Is there an opportunity to buy a put option cheaply right now, which might possibly be priced very improperly at this moment. I don't know if one month is far enough out, but things seem to be moving reasonably fast now, so perhaps the dust is settled by then. If you could spend cheaply enough to buy a put option to sell at say $50 a month from now would that constitute a intelligent asymmetrical bet? At some point the shorts will either be liquidated or cover, the \"ryan cohen\" die-hard believers may stay for the turn around story, but the price pressure is off and all the gamblers start heading for the exits so they can participate in the next gamble. The prisoner's dilemma domino's will start falling. Even if the price eventually settled higher, the downward swing might very well spike down well below $50, or less, during this time.\n\nLooking at cnbc's put options for Feb and March the answer for me was no. Prices look too high for comfort, a lot of people smarter than me have probably already considered this and driven the price up, perhaps as hedges or speculations in the same vein as outlined above. I don't have the skill to figure out at $7 if a $40 PUT option one month out is an intelligent speculation to pick up, so for me it would still just be gambling. If that same put was 75 cents, I could accept it's likely at least a smart speculation, and if not it's cheap enough to take a flyer on. At $6 to $7 I can't. Long tails and options are a fascinating world. Shame I didn't pay more attention in math class.\n\nCurious who else has been ruminating on this, if you have any other perspectives.",

        "selftext": "**In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation. \n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9), which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA. \n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach. \n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax. \n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.   \n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\u2026 I think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40. \n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology. \n\nThe company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all. \n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

Lots of people did. I looked at gamestop in 2019, a few times in fact. **I passed.** /u/DeepFuckingValue **didn't.** **We were both right.**\n\n/u/DeepFuckingValue looked at the company a year or two years back, and evaluated the numbers and the situation, and understood that a lot of short sellers were counting on this company to fold in the very near future. He probably also noticed that more and more short sellers seemed to be jumping on this bandwagon. He knew the situation wasn't nearly that dire. In fact it was likely to be \"game on\" for Gamestop, for quite a while to come. I got puns all night, so buckle up. Then he looked at the share price, understood the proposition and probability that this was a potentially very asymmetric opportunity (low probability, enormous return, mispriced very cheaply in relation to the potential return). I looked at the same things, but he got from the situation contextual understanding I didn't get. Namely the magnitude to which shorts can backfire and how to estimate it.\n\nI also recognized, back in 2019, Gamestop was probably not in as dire straights as predicted. I wasn't alone, or special in this. Lots of people, including some famous people, recognized it. Michael Burry. Ryan Cohen. That one guy from the internet. I knew about the gaming console cycle too. I looked over the balance sheet. I got that piece of the puzzle, lots of us did.

He understood the proposition, evaluated what he was PAYING for what he was GETTING (in this case not just the companies liquidation value backstop, but the potential possibilities of the price appreciation he could be getting - this eventual squeeze), knew himself well enough to decide if he could stomach the roller coaster, and chose to get on the ride.\n\nI'm genuinely happy for this guy, and everybody else on these message boards in that rocket or just popcorning along in the theatre. I'm also happy for myself, because even though I didn't have any money stake in GME I understand more about how short selling and squeezes work than I did just a week ago. I got a free option on education.\n\nThe ups and downs are not risk. Volatility is not risk. Here's where we get vague, because this GME story isn't over. It's only gotten started. This has implications for the broader market. Follow me into the fog of tomorrow, will you?\n\nEven the smartest, brightest people taking this bet 1 or 2 years ago had to contend with a lot of fog. It's not gone. Certainly the picture is MORE clear now than it was last year, but things are still REALLY FOGGY. More foggy for some of us than others. What we're witnessing now is why you cannot apply mathematics to complex systems (especially systems involving people) and expect everything to go as modeled. We don't have all the rules. This isn't chess, it's life. People cheat, bend the rules, propagandize, lobby, sue, counter-sue, weaponize fear and do everything in their capacity to get an advantage, up to and including breaking the law. Life isn't chess, it's poker. But it's way more complicated than a game of hold em. It's poker with 10,000 players at your table and a deck of 2.6 million cards, and a roof that might cave in once in a while and kill some of the people at the table, and one of the waiters serving drinks, and maybe the general mood in the room. Also someone who loses might pull out a gun and shoot the dealer. We cannot know all the things that might happen. But if you're in the casino we call earth, some of these events could affect you. I'm long on humans going to Mars, or Europa, or The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. God rest your soul, Douglas Adams.\n\nThis is why the proposition that the early birds took, people like /u/DeepFuckingValue, is nothing whatsoever the same as the proposition that exists right now. Even if you and I have the same understanding of the proposition he took 2 years ago, and understand why it makes sense, it's not the same proposition that exists now. He bought in at I don't know what, $2 or $5/share. Some long dated options that cost a few pennies. People buying in now are paying $100, $200, $400/share. Refusing to pay too much is your biggest defense against being stupid. Don't be stupid.\n\nIf you're a fan of that Stranger Things show, you probably recognize that theme. \"Don't be stupid.\" \"We're not stupid.\" In that case, we have something else in common. I love that show. There's a beautiful scene in that show where the adopted dad Hopper is trying to explain to this orphaned, frustrated teenager Eleven why she can't go outside. It's not safe. The risk is too high. Dangerous people are after you, and they aren't playing by the rules. Hopper and Eleven are arguing and bickering about this, and neither can see the other person's side. They are both right, for different reasons.\n\nThis is a fictional show, and she is an extraordinarily powerful telekinetic. She can move stuff with her mind. Violently. The government scientists who raised her and trained this ability are after her. Hopper doesn't understand this yet. She can rip people in half with a willful thought. *She's not in danger*.\n\nExcept she is. There are things she doesn't get. Weaknesses she hasn't accounted for. She's got this great little group of friends, and they aren't superheroes. They've got families. Real people she cares about, who are regular people and definitely can be hurt. This is what Hopper is trying to get across. He's got experience, he's lost people. He knows. She thinks he's just an old grumpy boomer and he thinks she's just an emotional child. But they're talking past each other, and as teenagers are wont to do, rash decisions are made and things get out of hand. People die.\n\nThis has so many parallels with what's going on in Gamestop (and the markets broadly) recently. People, \"the bad guys\", are not playing by the rules. Other people, \"the good guys\", did not account for this ratfuckery. Now there's a tug of war. In the media, the courts, the SEC, congress, even in the public square of reddit and twitter. The proposition that *was* when /u/DeepFuckingValue and company investigated it 2 years ago is not the proposition that *is* today. Even if it was the same situation, he and I came to different conclusions for different reasons because he understood it and I did not.\n\nIf you want to be an investor, you've got to learn to say NO, and not because \"the other guy is wrong\". You say NO because you don't understand how to value what is being offered confidently, or you do understand it and you see risks in the proposition that make the price unattractive or this particular proposition untenable for your temperament. Just like anything else in life, be it dating, job offers, or nigerian prince's who just need a little help with an inheritance scheme, successful people learn to say No to almost everything. The most successful people learn to say No so gracefully the rejected party leaves feeling good about getting rejected.\n\nInvesting is saying No to offers you don't understand and requiring a bargain price. Speculation is everything else. At /r/ValueInvesting, *We're not stupid.*\n\nCorrected: The girls name is Eleven, not Seven. Fixed, Thanks /u/jelledm ",

        "selftext": "If there is one thing Warren Buffett is clear about, it is that gambling type of behavior, whether it is in the stock market or just buying a lottery ticket, will lead an investor astray. And, as opportunities to speculate look ever more enticing, it\u2019s most important to remember that just because you can gamble doesn\u2019t mean that you should.\n\n\u201cPeople win lotteries every day, but there\u2019s no reason to have that effect you at all. You shouldn\u2019t be jealous about it,\u201d Buffett said at the 2016 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting. \u201cIf they want to do mathematically unsound things, and one of them occasionally gets lucky, and they put the one person on television, and the million that contributed to the winnings, with the big slice taken out for the state, you know, don\u2019t get on, it\u2019s nothing to worry about. Just, all you have to do is figure out what makes sense\u2026When you buy a stock, you get yourself in the mental frame of mind that you\u2019re buying a business, and if you don\u2019t look at a quote on it for five years, that\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t get a quote on your farm every day or every week or every month. You don\u2019t get it on your apartment house, if you own one. If you own a McDonald\u2019s franchise, you don\u2019t get a quote every day. You know, you want to look at your stocks as businesses, and think about their performance as businesses. Think about what you pay for them, as you would think about buying a business, and let the rest of the world go its own way.

Please continue to report these to bring them to the mods' attention. \n\n2) Low quality posts like \"What do you think about $XYZ?\" or \"What stocks are good this week\"? are being removed and posters are being referred to the Weekly Megathread.  That's what it's there for.  I admit this is highly subjective, and I'm swayed by upvotes/downvotes.  This is something new we just started doing to improve post quality. \n\n3) r/ValueInvesting is not r/WallStreetBets, and we're not going to allow it to start looking and sounding like WSB.  I've been allowing some level of meta-discussion about the current news, but I am removing comments and low-quality posts that sound like WSB cheerleading, in particular comments using WSB-style emojis when I see them.  \n\n4) We continue to remove YouTube posts that are spammed to multiple subreddits.  YouTube videos that are relevant and only posted here as a one-off thing are still allowed.  Again, it's subjective and I take upvotes and posting history of the account into consideration. \n\n5) We don't ban or block Seeking Alpha articles, but Reddit seems to quarantine link posts to SA or text posts and comments that include links to SA.  They end up the mod queue, and I generally approve them.  But if nobody's replying to you, maybe that's why. \n\n6) We have lots of patience and a high bar for banning accounts. Probably a higher bar than many of you would like.  On the other hand, I have zero tolerance for ban-evasion or reposting things the mods already removed once. \n\nAgain, welcome to all our new members, and thanks to all our long-time members for helping keep this sub a respectful forum for value investors of all experience levels!",

        "selftext": "This original Base Hit Investing website returns a [410](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#410) (intentionally removed). I previously had taken a snapshot of this post and wanted to reflect on some of the concepts again. For the community I've gone ahead and converted the post to text for /r/ValueInvesting's [wiki/archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/wiki/index):\n\n***\n\n# My Investment Checklist\n\n^(Posted on June 7, 2013 by John Huber)\\\n^(John Huber is the portfolio manager of Saber Capital Management, LLC, an investment firm that manages separate accounts for clients. Saber employs a value investing strategy with a primary goal of patiently compounding capital for the long-term.)\n\nA few different readers have asked about checklists and whether I use one. I have started to recently, and have found it helpful. A year or two ago I heard Mohnish Pabrai talking about [the Checklist Manifesto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6667514-the-checklist-manifesto), and how he implemented his own checklist into his investment routine. Pabrai made an analogy to pilots, who go through a detailed checklist just prior to a flight. Using a checklist can help you catch something you didn\u2019t check or didn\u2019t think about. It can also make your investment routine more organized and efficient.\n\nMohnish didn\u2019t publish his, saying that it would be more beneficial for one to develop his or her own. I would agree with this, because each investing style and process is somewhat unique. Plus, the process of building the list is beneficial because it gets you thinking about what you value when you buy a stock.\n\nNevertheless, I thought I\u2019d share mine on the blog. This is really nothing special. And it\u2019s not nearly as detailed as Mohnish\u2019s 88 question checklist. It\u2019s just meant to basically reaffirm my thesis and help me make sure I\u2019ve covered the basics. Another difference I have with Pabrai is that my checklist is used after I\u2019ve spent some time looking at the investment opportunity, but not before doing a lot of detailed research. I think he mentions that he runs his checklist right before making a \u201cbuy or not buy\u201d decision.\n\nSo without further comments, here is the screenshot of my checklist. I\u2019d love to hear any thoughts or recommendations, or if you have your own checklist, feel free to share/comment:\n \n\n### First, Keep in Mind the Three Categories of Risk:\n\n* Valuation Risk\n* Leverage Risk\n* Business Risk\n\n\n### Then, Check the 2 Most Important Metrics: EV/EBIT and ROC:\n\n* Enterprise Value to Normalized Earnings\n* Return on Capital\n\n\n### Check Valuation:\n\n* EV/EBIT is best (also check EV/EBITDA-private equity's metric)\n* EV/FCF (also check current EV to 10-year average FCF)\n* P/B or P/TBV for financials and certain asset-based investments\n* EV/Sales for certain industries\n* Historical and Relative Valuation\n  * How is the valuation compared to the 10 year historical valuations?\n  * How does the valuation compare to the other companies in the industry?\n\n\n### Check Leverage:\n\n* Debt to Equity Ratio\n* Current Ratio\n\n\n### Check Business and Quality Metrics:\n\n* Return on Capital (ROC and ROA) - are they stable over time?\n* Book Value - is growing over time?\n* Sales - is growing over time?\n* Free Cash Flow - is growing over time?\n* Operating Cash Flow (or EBITDA) - consistent?\n  * If it's an asset-based investment, is the company showing a history of profitability?\n* Margins (Gross and Operating) - are they consistent over time?\n  * How do margins compare to other companies in the industry?\n\n\n### Insiders:\n\n* Do insiders own much stock? Relative to their salaries?\n* Are they buying stock recently?\n\n\n### Capital Allocation:\n\n* Stock buybacks - are shares outstanding increasing or decreasing over time?\n* Dividends - are they increasing over time?\n* How has management allocated capital in the past?\n* Has management announced recent changes to their capital allocation strategy?\n\n\n### Important Considerations:\n\n* Is the business a melting ice cube?\n* Does the business operate in a cyclical industry?\n* Are the current earnings peak, normal, or trough?\n* For asset investments, are assets tangible or is goodwill included?\n\n\n### State brief investment thesis:\n\n* What does the business do and how do they make money?\n* Why is this stock a good investment?\n  * EV?EBIT and ROC most important metrics\n  * Any catalysts or hidden values?\n* What are the risks?\n\n\n### Final Questions:\n\n* Can I see this stock doubling in 2-3 years?\n* Would I want to buy more if the stock drops after I buy it?\n\n\n\nThe basic idea behind my checklist is to focus on the three basic categories of risk: Valuation risk, Leverage risk, and Business risk. All risk can be traced to one of these three areas, and using a checklist can help you mitigate these risks.\n\n## Last Two Questions Are Key\n\nThe final two questions really help me stay focused on prioritizing investment opportunities. I think about the risk and the downside first, but once that is handled, in order to make money you still need upside. Asking the simple question: **\u201cWill this stock double?\u201d** has had a surprisingly helpful effect. It also allows me to toss aside mediocre opportunities so I can focus more on the best risk-reward scenarios. By the way, this question was also something I learned from Pabrai.\n\nThe last question is another very basic one, but again-it\u2019s quite helpful. **\u201cWould I buy more?\u201d** It forces me to think about the fact that I\u2019m buying a business and not just speculating on an increase in stock price. If the answer to this question is: \u201cno\u201d (assuming the thesis hasn\u2019t changed), then you may want to pass on the investment.\n\n**There is no science to any of this.** The idea is to simply implement something to get you thinking about everything that is important to you when you make an investment. I just started using a formal checklist, and I\u2019ll probably add to this over time, including more qualitative questions, but for now, this seems to be helpful in organizing my thoughts and prioritizing opportunities.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n***\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\nJohn posted a follow-up-esque post a few years later. I believe John's intent was to replace the original above with a new approach\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n***\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Two Key Checklist Items\n\n^(Posted on September 13, 2016 by John Huber)\\\n^(John Huber is the portfolio manager of Saber Capital Management, LLC, an investment firm that manages separate accounts for clients. Saber employs a value investing strategy with a primary goal of patiently compounding capital for the long-term.)\n\nI am not a big fan of going through specific \u201cchecklist\u201d items one by one when evaluating an investment idea. I know this idea has gained enormous popularity in recent years, partly due to the good book The Checklist Manifesto, and partly popularized in value investing circles by Mohnish Pabrai.\n\nI respect Mohnish a lot, and I think his idea of evaluating previous investment mistakes (both his own mistakes and especially the mistakes of other great investors) is an excellent exercise.\n\nOne investment mistake to study would be Pabrai\u2019s own investment in Horsehead Holdings (ZINC). This investment would be a case study that maybe I\u2019ll put together for a separate post sometime, as it\u2019s one that I followed during the time he owned it. There are a few reasons why I always scratched my head at why he bought ZINC, and there are a few reasons why I think it ultimately didn\u2019t work, but one thing I\u2019ll point out is what Buffett said in his 2004 shareholder letter (thanks to my friend Saurabh Madaan who runs the Investor Talks at Google for pointing me to this passage):  \n\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cLast year MidAmerican wrote off a major investment in a zinc recovery project that was initiated in 1998 and became operational in 2002. Large quantities of zinc are present in the brine produced by our California geothermal operations, and we believed we could profitably extract the metal. For many months, it appeared that commercially-viable recoveries were imminent. But in mining, just as in oil exploration, prospects have a way of \u201cteasing\u201d their developers, and every time one problem was solved, another popped up. In September, we threw in the towel.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \u201cOur failure here illustrates the importance of a guideline\u2014stay with simple propositions\u2014that we usually apply in investments as well as operations. If only one variable is key to a decision, and the variable has a 90% chance of going your way, the chance for a successful outcome is obviously 90%. But if ten independent variables need to break favorably for a successful result, and each has a 90% probability of success, the likelihood of having a winner is only 35%. In our zinc venture, we solved most of the problems. But one proved intractable, and that was one too many. Since a chain is no stronger than its weakest link, it makes sense to look for\u2014if you\u2019ll excuse an oxymoron\u2014mono-linked chains.\u201d\n&gt; \n\nThis sounds very similar to the problem that Horsehead Holdings (ZINC) had with its zinc facility in North Carolina. Without going into details, I think there were too many variables that needed to go right for ZINC to work out as an investment.\n\nBut let me just say that mistakes are part of investing. So many people are so quick to cast judgment on investors like Pabrai, David Einhorn, or Bill Ackman when they make big mistakes. I\u2019m not apologizing for these investors, but I think that those who are criticizing these investors should look at their entire body of work to draw conclusions, not just one bad investment. These three are very good investors with outstanding long-term records that have vastly exceeded the S&amp;P 500, and they should be judged on that record, not the underperformance of the past couple years.\n\nBut regardless of what you think of these investors, it helps to try and learn from their mistakes. I wrote a post on Valeant a while back, which is Ackman\u2019s biggest error. I also looked at SunEdison, which was an Einhorn investment. It is infinitely easier in hindsight (the rearview mirror is always clear) to attribute reasons for why these investments didn\u2019t work out, but nevertheless, I think it\u2019s helpful to study these mistakes.\n\nI don\u2019t think a 100-point checklist would have been necessary to pass on any of these three investments (ZINC, VRX, or SunEdison). Two of the three companies were ultra-focused on growing revenue regardless of the return on capital associated with that growth, using the so-called \u201croll-up\u201d approach. **All three of these investments saw their losses dramatically accentuated by debt.**\n\nI think each of these investments hinged on a few key variables (in addition to debt), and I think rather than running through a generic \u201cpre-flight\u201d checklist, a better method is to have a few very broad checklist items, and then determine the key variables that really matter regarding the business in question.\n\nWhat do I mean by \u201cbroad checklist items\u201d? One general checklist that Buffett and Munger use:\n\n1. Do I understand the business?\n2. Is this a good business? (Competitive advantages, high returns on capital, etc\u2026)\n3. Is management competent and ethical?\n4. Is the price attractive?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get much simpler than that, and I think this 4-point filter is a common denominator that could be used on just about every investment.\n\nObviously, there is a lot of thought and analysis that goes into answering those simple questions, and so there are sub-categories that might pop up.\n\n## Key Checklist/Concept #1\n\nThis isn\u2019t really a checklist item. But it\u2019s a takeaway I\u2019ve had through my own experiences:\n\n### Whenever I find myself getting more attracted to the security than I am to the business, it\u2019s often a good reason to pass\n\nMy mistakes have almost always come from investing in \u201ccheap\u201d stocks of subpar businesses. I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019m better off focusing on good businesses. This means missing certain opportunities, but for me, it also means reducing errors. Also, when it comes to managing other people\u2019s money at Saber Capital Management, I don\u2019t feel comfortable owning low-quality businesses, regardless of how attractive the valuation appears to be. I mentioned this on Twitter recently and it sparked some interesting discussions.\n\nThere are a number of investors who disagree with me on this point. Some investors make a lot of money buying crappy businesses that are beaten down to really cheap valuation levels. It\u2019s possible to make excellent returns buying garbage that no one else wants and selling them when the extreme pessimism abates some. This is the approach that guys like Walter Schloss used to great success in the 1950\u2019s-1970\u2019s\u2014the so-called \u201ccigar butt\u201d style of investing.\n\nBut I think one big difference between the cigar butts of yesteryear and the stocks that investors get attracted to today is the debt levels on the balance sheet. The cigar butts that I read being pitched today are often questionable businesses that are loaded with debt. If things turn around and the company survives, the equity can appreciate multiples from its current level. If not, the company goes bankrupt and the equity gets wiped out.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to become very good at handicapping these types of situations, but it\u2019s not my style of investing. I choose to pass on these overleveraged companies with minimal chances of success.\n\n### Low Probability, High Payoff Investment Ideas\n\nThis brings me to another point I want to make regarding estimating probabilities. I read investment pitches all the time that discuss the probability of various outcomes. This makes sense\u2014Buffett himself has talked about assigning probabilities to various outcomes of an investment. And certain odds might tell you that even a low probability event can be a very good bet to take. For example, a bet that has a 25% chance of winning and pays out 10 to 1 is a very good bet. It is a low probability bet that has positive expectancy, and it\u2019s a bet you should take every time.\n\nBut I generally pass on low-probability ideas for the following two reasons:\n\n1. **Unlike cards or dice (or other games of chance where probability can be more or less accurately determined), business and investing are dynamic with ever-changing odds.**/ Cards and dice are closed-systems with a finite set of possible outcomes. Business is fluid, and there are an infinite set of unpredictable events that can greatly impact the outcome. It\u2019s unreasonable to assign rigid probabilities to these types of situations.\n2 **Investors tend to overestimate the likelihood of success of low-probability events**/ To use the above example, an investor might assume a 25% odds of success and a 10 to 1 payoff; but in reality it\u2019s just 10% odds with a 5 to 1 payoff. The investor might accurately describe all of the moving parts of the investment, and rightly understand that it is a low-probability event, but still be way off with his or her estimate of risk/reward and thus make a bad bet. It is too easy to arbitrarily assign overly optimistic probabilities to this type of investment in an effort to justify buying the stock.\n\nA year or two ago I read numerous Dex Media write-ups (the company that published phone books), including one by Kyle Bass. DXM was an equity stub\u2014a sliver of equity with a huge amount of debt on a dying business that was trying to make a transition to digital from print. All of the write-ups recognized the obvious struggles of the business, and all recognized that odds of success were too low. But I think those who bought the stock overestimated the odds of success and/or the amount of the potential payoff. One investor said the DXM payoff could be as high as 100-1. This reward could justify an investment even at a very low likelihood of success.\n\nThe Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investment cases might be current examples of this type of low-probability, high-payoff type investment. Maybe these will work out, but I think many are overestimating the likelihood of success.\n\nIn my experience, it\u2019s better to forego the low-probability investment ideas. They are too difficult to accurately judge, and they usually involve bad (or highly leveraged) businesses.\n\n## Key Checklist/Concept #2\n\nSchloss invested in poor-quality businesses in many instances. How was he so successful? Schloss used a checklist of sorts, and the very last (but not least) item on his checklist was:\n\n### Be careful of leverage. It can go against you.\n\nThis seemingly oversimplified statement is really great advice. I think that while Schloss invested in businesses with subpar (or no) competitive advantages, he was able to do well because of his patience and his willingness to wait for the cycle to turn. Many of his investments were in capital intensive, cyclical businesses\u2014but most of the companies he bought had clean balance sheets.\n\nToday, our society is much more accepting of higher debt levels\u2014both at the personal level and at the corporate level. Because of the availability of debt made possible in part through securitization, it is much easier for companies to gain access to credit than it was in the 1950\u2019s. Most companies that Schloss would have looked at in his day are now saddled with debt in an attempt to improve their inherent low returns on equity through leverage. Schloss was satisfied with the low ROE\u2019s, as he figured he wasn\u2019t paying much for it, and eventually, the earning power would inevitably turn higher as the business cycle turned from bust back to boom.\n\nThe business cycle still has the same fluctuations of course, but leverage now magnifies the equity values. I see scores of oil and gas producers whose stocks have risen 500% or more since the February lows. Leverage has magnified the comeback in their equity values. **It also would have been their death knell had oil prices not bounced in the nick of time.**\n\nSchloss said in a Forbes article in 1973\u2014aptly titled \u201cMaking Money Out of Junk\u201d that there are three things that can go in your favor when you buy cheap, out of favor companies:\n\n* Earnings turn around and the stock appreciates significantly\n* Someone buys control of the company (buyout)\n* The company begins buying its own stock\n\nHowever, you need a clean balance sheet to put yourself in position to capitalize on a cyclical upturn and the corresponding rebound in earning power that could come with it.\n\n### Where the Puck is Going\n\nStanley Druckenmiller gave an excellent talk early last year where he mentioned one of the two key things his mentor taught him:  \n\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cNever, ever invest in the present. It doesn\u2019t matter what a company is earning, (or) what they have earned. He taught me that you have to visualize the situation 18 months from now\u2026 Too many people tend to look at the present\u2026\u201d\n&gt; \n\nBuffett has mentioned closing his eyes and visualizing where a company is 10 years from now, or being happy owning the stock if the exchange shut down for five years.\n\nI don\u2019t think it matters what the exact length of time is, but the point is that when you make an investment in a stock, you\u2019re buying a piece of a business. When I look out to a certain point into the future, whether its 18 months or 5 years, I\u2019d rather try to focus on a company that I think will be doing more business, have greater earning power, and be more valuable than it is today.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n***\n\nI'm going to reflect on both of these posts and share my thoughts via a comment in a few days.\n\n&amp;nbsp;",

        "selftext": "**Should you buy Apple stock or has the company run out of growth opportunities? What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks &amp; months!**\n\n**\\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! So, let\u2019s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.\n\n**\\[Disclosure: I made this DD last month, but I wasn't part of this Subreddit until the last few days\\]**\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will affect developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company\u2019s total net sales in the last fiscal year.\n\nAlso, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.\n\nAlongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook\u2019s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.\n\nWe also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that\u2019s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.\n\nThe 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular. This will also be helped by the recent entry to the Indian [market](https://postimg.cc/7fV6BHNS), as India will probably become the world biggest country in the next decade, this could be a huge opportunity for Apple to start and take away market-share from their competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi which have the biggest market shares right now.\n\nThey also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.\n\nBut the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to offer more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.\n\nThe latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you different information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.\n\nI think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more &amp; more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.\n\nWe also shouldn\u2019t forget the Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital &amp; contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.\n\nAnd one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also offering self-driving capabilities.\n\nIt\u2019s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.\n\nI think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the effective manufacturing of cars. Apple\u2019s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.\n\nBut this Apple Car thing is so far out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.\n\nAnd last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.\n\nI also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don\u2019t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.\n\nSo, before even starting, you should know that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don\u2019t be afraid to leave a comment down below.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.\n\nThis are my 2025 projections for Apple, let\u2019s take a closer look at them, each on their own.\n\nSo, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of income, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by far the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.\n\nThe next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.\n\nThe iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.\n\nThe 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home &amp; accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.\n\nI gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more &amp; more popular as they start to offer more vertical integration.\n\nAnd last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple offers. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based income including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don\u2019t forget any others.\n\nSo, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.\n\nI think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.\n\nIn terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \\[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \\] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.\n\nIn the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company\u2019s supplier\u2019s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will effectively double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.\n\nSo, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross income for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.\n\nI also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.\n\nI think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don\u2019t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.\n\nThis money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.\n\nMoving on, let\u2019s see what interest income and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying off debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both income and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.\n\nThis would bring the company pre-tax income to just over $104B in 2025.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to taxes. I know the Federal income tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual effective tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average effective tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% effective tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.\n\nSo, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in income after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don\u2019t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today\u2019s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.\n\nI don\u2019t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.\n\nSo [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.\n\nI think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3B shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.\n\nSo here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \\[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \\] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nKeep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?\n\nThe company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news &amp; sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn\u2019t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can officially say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it\u2019s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I really believe this company will remain the biggest or one of the biggest in the future, so I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock. As I believe Apple is one of the most stable stocks out there with large institutional [holders](https://postimg.cc/3kqG3XcK) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Berkshire owning over 900M shares each.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Honestly guys.\n\nI'm not some boomer and I understand there is space within the value investing field for technology stocks, but on the front fucking page we have analyses for AAPL and AMZN, two of **the biggest technology stocks** currently that are **massively over-priced** and have been massively over-priced since before the ridiculous stimulus benefits they've received since the start of COVID.\n\nPlease understand, I am not specifically short AAPL or AMZN. I know and will freely say these are strong, respectable companies with long, profitable futures ahead of them. But, are we seriously so lazy that *these* are the stocks that get voted to the front page? Are any of you upvoting these actually value investors?\n\nTake some of the most respected value investors out there. Warren Buffet, Mike Burry, Seth Klarman, you name it. These guys wouldn't touch these companies with 10,000-foot poles. Warren Buffet listened to his partner and bought into AAPL at a time where its P/E was mid single digits and it was hammered by negative news following poor tech releases. Mike Burry has stated that his *entire investment philosophy* is based around the concept \"margin of safety\". Seth Klarman? He wrote a fucking book titled \"Margin of Safety\".\n\nIn no god damn way shape or form do AMZN or AAPL offer *any* margin of safety.

        "selftext": "This will be long....Sorry in advance. I decided I'd like to research Michael Burry since I've seen so many people talking about him on here and this is just what I've discovered about him and his methods.\n\n**Quick Facts:**\n\n* Founder of hedge fund Scion Capital 2000-2008. Closed to focus on personal investments\n* Best known for seeing the subprime mortgage crisis (2007-2010) and profiting from it\n* Investment style is built upon Benjamin Graham and David Dodd\u2019s 1934 book Security Analysis: \"All my stock picking is 100% based on the concept of a margin of safety.\"\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n* Michael Burry's strategy as he states is not very complex. He tries to buy shares of unpopular companies when the look like roadkill, and sell them when they've been cleaned up a bit. Lets take a look at his Q2 2020 Positions, top buys, and top sells. There are a few that are not big surprises but check it out.\n\n|Stock|Shares|Market Value|% of Portfolio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|GOOG / Alphabet Inc Class C (CALL)|80,000\t| $113,089,000 | 35.87 |\n| FB / Facebook Inc (CALL) | 93,200 | $21,163,000 | 6.71 |\n| BKNG / Booking Holdings Inc (CALL) | 11,600 | $18,471,000 | 5.86 |\n| GS / Goldman Sachs Group (CALL) | 73,600 | $14,545,000 | 4.61 |\n| GME / Gamestop Corp | 2,750,000 | $11,935,000 | 3.79 |\n| WDC / Western Digital Inc (CALL) | 270,000 | $11,921,000 | 3.78 |\n| BBBY / Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc | 1,000,000 | $10,600,000 | 3.36 |\n| DISCA / Discovery Inc | 500,000 | $10,550,000 | 3.35 |\n| TCOM / Trip.com Inc | 325,000 | $8,424,000 | 2.67 |\n| QRVO / Qorvo Inc | 75,000 | $8,290,000 | 2.63 |\n\n* **Top Buys**\n   * GOOG / Alphabet Inc Class C (CALL)\n   * FB / Facebook Inc (CALL)\n   * BKNG / Booking Holdings Inc (CALL)\n   * GS / Goldman Sachs Group (CALL)\n   * WDC / Western Digital Inc (CALL)\n* **Top Sells**\n   * Jack / Jack In The Box Inc\n   * FB / Facebook Inc\n   * BA / Boeing Inc\n   * MAXR / Maxar Technologies Ltd\n   * QRVO / Qorvo Inc\n\nMr. Burry's weapon of choice is his **research** and that it's critical for him to understand a company's value before laying down a dime and that 100% of his stock picking is based on the concept of margin of safety introduced in the book \"Security Analysis\" which I am reading through right now and dang is it huge lol. He also states that he has his own version of their technique, but that the net is that he wants to protect his downside to prevent permanent loss of capital. Specific, known catalyst are not necessary. Sheer, outrageous value is enough.\n\nHe cares little about the level of the general market and puts few restrictions on potential investments. They can be large-cap stocks, small cap, mid cap, micro cap, tech or non-tech and finds out-of-favor industries a particularly fertile ground for best-of-breed shares at **steep discounts**.\n\n**How does he determine the discount?**\n\n* Focuses on free cash flow and enterprise value (Market capitalization less cash plus debt)\n* Screen companies by look at enterprise value/EBITDA ratio. Accepted ratio varies with the industry and it position in the economic cycle\n* If stock passes loose screen, looks harder to determine specific price and value of a company\n   * Takes into account off-balance sheet items and true free cash flow\n   * Ignores price-earning ratios\n   * Return of equity is deceptive and dangerous\n   * Prefers minimal debt\n   * Adjust book value to a realistic number\n* Invest in rare birds - asset plays, and to a lesser extent, arbitrage opportunities and companies selling at less than two-thirds of net value\n* Will mix in with companies favored by Warren Buffet **IF** they become available at good prices. Deserving of longer holding periods.\n\n**How many Stocks does he hold?**\n\n* Likes to hold 12 to 18 stocks diversified among various depressed industries, and tends to be fully invested. Provides enough room for his best ideas and helps with volatility.\n* Feels volatility is no relation to risk.\n\n**Tax Implications**\n\n* Not concerned much about tax. Know his portfolio turnover will generally exceed 50% annually, and at 20% the long-term tax benefits of low-turnover pretty much disappear.\n\n**When he buys**\n\n* He mixes barebones technical analysis into his strategy. \n* Prefers to buy within 10% to 15% of a 52-week low that has shown itself to offer some price support. If a stock other than a rare bird breaks a new low, in most cases he cuts the loss.\n   * Balances the fact that he is turning his back on potentially greater value with the fact that since implementing this rule he hasn't had a single misfortunate blow up his entire portfolio\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In the end, investing is neither a science nor an art - it is a scientific art.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Works Cited**\n\n[https://acquirersmultiple.com/2020/08/michael-burrys-top-10-holdings-q2-2020-plus-top-buys-sells/](https://acquirersmultiple.com/2020/08/michael-burrys-top-10-holdings-q2-2020-plus-top-buys-sells/)\n\n[https://acquirersmultiple.com/2017/11/michael-burry-search-for-unpopular-companies-that-look-like-road-kill/](https://acquirersmultiple.com/2017/11/michael-burry-search-for-unpopular-companies-that-look-like-road-kill/)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael\\_Burry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry)",

He saw value in a a market dominance or a brand that others didn't. And the 10-year record of high ROE with earnings not skipping a beat wasn't necessarily there to prove it when he bought. But there was nonetheless a margin of safety.\n\nIMO, the biggest impediment to investing in the spirit of Buffett is the idea that somehow we can be a 100% imitator of him and see the same success. That anyone could be a perfect imitator of his approach strikes me as ridiculous. Try compounding the 10% difference between even your best imitator and Buffett over 30 years.\u00a0\n\nI don't have it down yet. But in terms of investing in the spirit of Buffett (rather than in his mirror image), neither does anyone else here that I can see. I'm young. I'm reading a lot and continuously reviewing and updating my approach as new revelations occur. Remember I said \"Buffett-like stock for me,\" not you. If it was that easy for you to see, I'd be disappointed. I'm certainly glad I can't find anyone to agree with me on this. If anything, it indicates I'm headed in the right direction.\"",

I've owned a piece of this company for maybe 7 or 8 months. It's been in the ditch, badly. For a while, it was not entirely unreasonable to be in the ditch. Retail was more or less closed indefinitely and we didn't know how COVID was going to sort itself out or what the government's of the world intended to do. But the thing is, it was (in my view) fairly priced before COVID was a thought on anybody's mind. It's got a solid track record of earnings, suitable fundamentals, and no particular reason I could see why it should be priced sub $4 a share, so I took a position. It had a kerfuffle with a flower delivery place that went bankrupt and might lose some of it's receivables due to that (2019) and perhaps some forward sales. Not great, but shit happens. That's a one time charge, not a permanent impairment. I bank on management generally being intelligent enough to move past these kinds of problems, find sales elsewhere and try to avoid a repeat in the future.\n\nThe last few days, after being as low as $2 this last year and hovering around $3-4 range basically all year, it has jumped to $6 almost overnight. What's changed? There's nothing I know of in the news, besides Valentine's Day coming up shortly. As far as I know, that's not a surprise. It happens every year. In fact if earnings were to continue the next 10 years something like the last (mostly .50 to .75 cents range), it's fair value is probably safely closer to $8-9. At their worst year (pre-covid) the earnings easily warranted a $2 price tag in my view, as their worst year was 2020, at 17 cents. Who knows what the future will bring, but this was a deal that was available throughout all this exuberant pricing (dating back even to my estimate of fair value during the first bout of prices running up in 2019).\n\nFor instance this is the diluted net earnings data I use for RMCF starting 2020 back ( 0.17 0.37 0.50 0.58 0.73 0.61 0.68 0.24 0.62 0.62 0.58 0.60 0.76 0.71 0.61 0.51 0.37 ).\n\nThis is a good example of the irrationality of prices in the stock market, at work. The business cannot have been worth $4.25 a share Thursday and be worth 40% more today. Business just doesn't work that way. Did people who have never eaten chocolate before suddenly get an insatiable craving for chocolate?\n\nKeep your eye on the prize, shop everyday. Something somewhere is always priced wrong. Occasionally you will understand enough about the situation or it will be obvious enough to safely take advantage. ***Do your own research and make your own decisions.***",

        "selftext": "Today I\u2019d like to share a useful thing I once learned from Warren and Charlie while listening to the Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings. This is intended for anyone new to value investing.\n\nHere\u2019s what Warren Buffett thinks are the 3 most important concepts in investing that will put you ahead of 99% of the competition on their own (restated in my own words):\n\n1. **Think of stocks as pieces of ownership in the underlying businesses, not as little pieces of paper that move up and down a chart.** Study quantitative and qualitative economic characteristics of the business (fundamentals) and decide whether the business has strong competitive advantages before investing. A useful framework to apply this is to imagine that you were purchasing the entire business (all shares outstanding instead of just a few).\n2. **The stock market and its price quotes are there to serve you, not to instruct you.** If you can avoid knee-jerk reactions to changes in price, that\u2019s a huge advantage. Instead, view price in relation to intrinsic value of the underlying business and make rational decisions based on that relationship. Following this framework, you\u2019ll find that the most common course of action is to do nothing and wait while most market participants are engaged in a trading frenzy.\n3. **Margin of safety.** This means that you only purchase securities that are trading at a significant discount to intrinsic value. For example, if you think a business is worth $10 per share and you want a 50% Margin of safety, you would only purchase the stock if the price dropped to $5 per share, assuming the underlying business is worth as much as before by your estimation. In my experience, some businesses require larger Margins of safety than others. Large, established brands with huge economic moats and competent management may only require a 20% Margin of safety.\n\n*^(Disclaimer: This post and any of my comment replies are for entertainment and educational purposes only.

In 2020, sales continued to increase with +10.9% increase in sales, +12.8% in profit and a healthy margin of 10.8% vs 10.6% in 2019. The highly successful F-35 program continued to shine with increased sales volumes. The delivery of aircraft to multiple international partners has allowed a degree of stability to revenues as LMT continues to ramp up production.\n\n**MFC (17%)**\n\nLMT produces precision aerospace and defence systems for over 50 allied country militaries with a number of contracts with the US military complex. The standout Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) continue to be popular products with increasing volumes sold and are the largest increases to operating profit in this sector vs 2019.\n\n**RMS (25%)**\n\nOne of the more diverse portfolios within the business and comes with a very high employee count with 34,000 employees working under the banner. This sector includes radar systems, electronic warfare, logistic systems, and helicopter programs. The standout performer is the Sikorsky helicopter program which boosted volumes and operating profit throughout 2020 vs 2019.\n\n**SPACE (18%)**\n\nHighly classified and an increasingly popular sector for investors in general looking for growth opportunities. The launching of a Space exploration ETF by ARK, SpaceX rockets sending astronauts to the ISS and investor fervour in Virgin Galactic Holdings ($SPCE) have made space exploration in-demand. SPACE includes Space Launches, Commercial &amp; Government satellites, and strategic missile lines of business. LMT are currently building a NASA Orion spaceship for the next flight to the moon by 2024, which will land the first woman on the moon.\n\n**2.

This strong growth combined with a pay-out ratio &lt;60% and an A- credit rating displays the strength of LMT and their ability to pay a dividend to shareholders.\n\n**5.** **Weaknesses**\n\nNow why shouldn\u2019t you invest in LMT? Well, there are a number of reasons:\n\nESG\n\nLet us face it, LMT develops weapons which will be used in conflict zones resulting in instability and death. You the investor are placing money into this system. Similar to Altria Group, some investors do not want to put their money into something they cannot morally agree to profit from (smoking).\n\nUS Government sensitivity\n\n71% of 2019\u2019s net sales came from the U.S. Government. Increased public scrutiny on the high US military spending combined with the 50/50 senate, could cause a slow creep away from profitable contracts. The Biden administration could also shy away from defence spending, coupled with further withdrawal from conflicts could cause a decline in revenues and margin.\n\n[https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/eo/documents/lockheed-martin-fact-sheet.pdf](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/eo/documents/lockheed-martin-fact-sheet.pdf)\n\nPrice\n\nAt $337/share, I imagine the average retail investor would balk at having to spend $33,700 in order to pick up a recommended 100 shares.\n\nTLDR: Buy $LMT, conservative upside of 10.5% + growing dividend.\n\nDisclaimer: I only own 1 share of $LMT (I felt I couldn't write a DD without owning *at least* 1 share) as I decided to pickup some value companies ( \u00a3IAG, $GE, $UAL and $PSEC) who at the time I felt were trading at extreme value.

A bad path not only sucks but is time lost on a good path.  I began to realize that some people may not only make me unhappy, but some could even ruin my life.  I began to choose my associations carefully, not in the pursuit of happiness but to avoid risk and catastrophe.  After developing habits for these things, my life has improved dramatically, and I have much more happiness anyway.  The more you live an honest, safe, and productive life, the easier it becomes to maintain these things.\n\nWhen I decided to start investing because I determined that making my savings produce something for me would contribute to that, I saw investors like Buffett basically just applied this mindset specifically to investing and developed best practices to figure this out in analysis.  Don't invest in companies that won't produce you long-term earnings, just like you wouldn't want to make deep relationships with people who will ditch you.  Don't buy a business with high debt or marry someone with awful credit.  Pick friends who keep promises, and buy businesses that uphold contracts.\n\nValue investing isn't some attempt at cracking the stock market like a lot of speculators would have you think with their own methods.  It's being a responsible person and applying that to investment.  If \"value investing is dead,\" then being a stable member of society is too.",

It is even an investment he would recommend for his wife after she inherits his assets, not that she would be selling her Berkshire Hathaway stock. \u201cThe object is not to maximize. It doesn\u2019t make any difference whether the amount she gets doubles or triples or anything of the sort. The important thing is that she never worries about money the rest of her life.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of money and worry, Buffett tells the story of his elderly aunt.\n\n\u201cI had an Aunt Katie here in Omaha, who Charlie knew well, and worked for her husband, as did I. And she worked very hard all her life. And had lived in a house she\u2019d paid, I think, I don\u2019t know, $8,000 for at 45th and Hickory all her life. And because she was in Berkshire, she ended up, she lived to 97, she ended up with, you know, a few hundred million. And she would write me a letter every four or five months. And she said, \u2018Dear Warren, you know, I hate to bother you. But am I going to run out of money?\u2019 And\u2026 I would write her back. And I\u2019d say, \u2018Dear Katie, it\u2019s a good question because, if you live 986 years, you\u2019re going to run out of money.\u2019\u201d\n\n**Buffett\u2019s full explanation on index funds**\n\n[https://mazorsedge.com/lessons-from-warren-buffett-why-index-funds-are-good-for-a-certain-type-of-investor/](http://mazorsedge.com/lessons-from-warren-buffett-why-index-funds-are-good-for-a-certain-type-of-investor/)",

I see value only as a discount from the intrinsic value of a company.\n\nI recently spoke to a friend about a company which I bought into and went through why I believed the stock was cheap in the traditional sense. My friend was baffled to learn that I thought that $30 a share was cheap. I walked him through the numbers. But, he interjected when I started talking about discounted owner\u2019s earnings. He said I should look into another company that he bought into. He said they were cheap and that I could buy shares for under $10. I began asking questions about why he thought the company was cheap. I heard nothing about valuation, upside, cash flow, growth, innovation, earnings, customers, etc. All he said was that the share price was low.\n\nI proceeded to explain to him that companies can be worth the same amount of money and one sells for $1 a share and one sells for $1000 a share. I explained that a billion dollar company can issue a billion shares for $1 each or they could issue a million shares for $1,000 each, yet at the end of the day, they are selling for the same price.\n\nAre we coming into a generation of very powerful day traders who are associating cheapness of a stock with a low share price? As with any irrational market participation, opportunity awaits disciplined and rational investors who choose to wait for companies selling at high per share prices to dip when they lose favor with the irrational participants thinking they are \u201cexpensive.\u201d\n\nJust take a look at this quote from the WSJ\u2019s James Mackintosh about a month ago describing performance related to share prices in 2020: **\u201cStocks priced below $1 have performed the best, followed by those between $1 and $2, and so on up almost perfectly.

Here, in this post, are the results. \n\n# The Rules\n\nFirst, the rules. Each rule below receives a point for a pass, and no points for a fail, much like the Piotroski Score.

(Share count today &lt; share count 5yr ago)\n* Rule 7 - IRR greater than Long-Term Treasury (initial rate of return &gt; 1.1%)\n* Rule 8 - ERR greater than 12% (expected rate of return &gt; 12% - calculated using analyst growth estimates)\n\nNow, the data.

He is willing to build up tens of billions in cash, even well over 100 billion, and not feel compelled to use it until the deal is right. According to Buffett, who has compared investing to being a baseball batter waiting for just the right pitch, the stock market is the ideal place for such patience.\n\n\u201cThe stock market is the most obliging, money-making place in the world because you don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d Warren Buffett said at the 2012 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting. \u201cYou know, you sit there with thousands of businesses being priced at the same price for the buyer and the seller\u2026 and it changes every day, and you\u2019ve got lots of information about most of those businesses, and you don\u2019t have to do anything. Compare that to any other investment alternative you\u2019ve got. I mean, you can\u2019t do that with farms. If you own a farm and the guy has the farm next to you and you\u2019d kind of like to buy him out or something, he\u2019s not going to name a price every day at which he\u2019ll buy your farm or sell you his farm, but you can do that with Berkshire Hathaway or IBM. It\u2019s a marvelous game. The rules are stacked in your favor, if you don\u2019t turn those rules upside down and start behaving like the drunken psychotic instead of the guy that\u2019s there to take advantage of it.\u201d\n\n**See Buffett\u2019s full explanation on being a patient investor, and the complete Lessons From Warren Buffett Series**\n\n[https://mazorsedge.com/lessons-from-warren-buffett-the-stock-market-is-the-most-obliging-money-making-place-in-the-world/](https://mazorsedge.com/lessons-from-warren-buffett-the-stock-market-is-the-most-obliging-money-making-place-in-the-world/)",

        "selftext": " \n\n## Chapter 6&amp;7: Portfolio policy and stocks for the aggressive investor\n\nI am summarizing and updating \u201cThe Intelligent Investor\u201d. If you have missed it here are the previous chapters: \n\n[Chapter 1: Investment vs Speculation](https://roiss.substack.com/p/lets-update-and-summarize-the-intelligent)\n\n[Chapter 2: Inflation and Investing](https://roiss.substack.com/p/lets-update-and-summarize-the-intelligent-5eb)\n\n[Chapter 3: Cycles and market psychology](https://roiss.substack.com/p/lets-update-and-summarize-the-intelligent-686)\n\n[Chapter 4&amp;5: Portfolio policy and stocks for the defensive investor](https://roiss.substack.com/p/lets-update-and-summarize-the-intelligent-e3a)\n\n[Chapter 6&amp;7: Portfolio policy and stocks for the aggressive investor](https://roiss.substack.com/p/the-intelligent-investor-portfolio)\n\nGraham\u2019s belief is that the aggressive investor should start from the same base as the defensive investor: Diversified holdings of stocks and bonds. To change this approach there needs to be a proper justification and research. The selection should not only depend on the competence but also the interest and the preferences of the investor in order to gain advantages. \n\nHe starts with a list of what to avoid. \n\n#### IPOs\n\nIPO or an Initial Public Offering is when a private company starts to offer shares that can be bought on exchanges. These should generally be avoided and Graham lists several reasons for it.\n\nThe first ist that the individual investor cannot buy at the underwriting price, so he is already at a disadvantage when the stock can be bought. The second is that IPOs tend to happen during favorable market conditions. This means that during bull-markets the number of IPOs become more frequent and the companies become poorer. \n\nWhile Graham is of the opinion that market timing is impossible, one fairly dependable sign to the end of a bull swing is the fact that new stocks of small nondescript companies are offered at prices somewhat higher than the current level for many medium-sized companies with a long market history. In March 2021 it seems that not only are many medium-sized companies eclipsed but also large ones. Churchill Capital IV, a SPAC with EV company Lucid Motors as it\u2019s planned merger partner, was valued at 47 billion dollars. The same as Ford, Honda and Fiat/Peugeot merger Stellantis. Time will tell if Lucid Motors is indeed the unicorn that is expected or more similar to VA Linux. VA Linux went public in 1999 and it\u2019s price skyrocketed to from 39$ to 239.5$ on the first day and valued at over 13 billion. Two years later the shares stood at 1.1.9$.\n\nDue to the high valuations during the bull market and the companies that go public most underperform the market and in times where the IPO craze reached extreme levels many lost more than 75%. \n\nEveryone dreams to buy the next Amazon, Microsoft or Apple at their IPO and make millions out of each dollar invested, however you don\u2019t have to take the increased risks to have spectacular investment returns. \n\nPeter Lynch gave the example of Walmart in one of his talks in 1994. Walmart went public in 1970 and already had a great history and balance sheet. You could have waited 10 years after it went public and made 35 times your money until 1994. If you bought it in 1994 your average return would be 10% annually. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/rf\\_f8GV0yYM?t=521\n\nThe same holds true for nearly every other great company. If you bought Amazon in 2010 after it was announced that e-book sales outnumbered its hardcover books, you would have 32% annual return up to March 2021. \n\nIt is often better to wait after the company\u2019s role in the market is established and it trades at a reasonable price. \n\n#### Junk Bonds\n\nJunk bonds according to Graham are while offering great potential returns in the same category as IPOs. Too risky and difficult to pick the right one. There are specialized junk bond funds but those generally come with such high fees that their returns are greatly diminished. \n\n#### Trading\n\nMost traders cannot outperform the market for a few reasons. Due to transaction fees or suboptimal bid/ask spreads, the profits get reduced. Then additional taxes leave a lot of money on the table. \n\n### How to achieve better returns as an aggressive Investor\n\nSince there is a fair amount of effort involved to obtain a better than run-of-the-mill investment return Graham outlines four ways to actually achieve great returns. \n\n1. Buying in low markets and selling in high ones \n2. Buying carefully chosen \u201cgrowth stocks\u201d\n3. Buying bargain issues of various types\n4. Buying into special situations. \n\n#### Growth stock approach\n\nA growth stock is a stock that achieved above average returns and is expected to do so in the future. Because of this it seems that the best investments should be concentrated on purely growth stocks, but it is a bit more complicated than that. \n\nThe first is that picking stocks from a group of successful companies of the last few years didn\u2019t necessarily lead to better returns. \n\n* Growth stocks dictate higher prices. The investor may be right in his judgement but the stock has those expectations already priced in. \n* The future might be different than one expects. Newer technologies or companies can emerge and \u201cdisrupt\u201d the disruptor. The speed of growth has also a limit and often the growth curve flattens and turns downwards faster than most investors expect. \n\nPicking the right growth stocks based on hindsight it is easy, but yet most growth funds have underperformed the index over 10 years. One should therefore not expect to make great returns or take on a riskier strategy in chase of yield. \n\nThe more growth is priced in the riskier a proposition becomes. An example in January 2021 would be Tesla. With a market cap of over 700 billion it is expected to become the leader not only in EV but other sectors as well. If that doesn\u2019t happen or the growth rate decreases wide market swings will follow. \n\nTo pick the right growth stocks Graham outlines two principles: \n\n* It must meet objective or rational tests of underlying soundness. \n* It must be different from the policy followed by most investors or speculators. \n\n#### Relatively unpopular large companies \n\nDue to unsatisfactory developments of temporary nature, large companies can often go on sale. Due to their resources in capital and brain power they are less risky than small unpopular stocks and can offer great opportunities. Because of their size the market will quickly price in favorable developments giving savvy investors opportunities to get a great return of their money. Examples are Apple in 2016 when the future about iPhone sales was questioned or tobacco at the end of 2020. These opportunities are not only based on low multiples but also on the overreaction of the market. \n\n#### Purchase of bargain issues\n\nA bargain issue is worth much more than it is selling for. An example would be when Michael Burry bought Gamestop at the end of 2019. Michael Burry who got famous due to his big short on the housing market, often invested in companies that \u201clook like roadkill\u201d. A case study of his early investments can be found [here](http://csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Michael-Burry-Case-Studies.pdf). \n\nThese opportunities arrive because the market makes mountains out of mole hills. Disappointing earnings or other events can lead to an oversell of the companies. The easiest bargain is a stock that sells less than the company's net working capital alone after deducting all prior obligations (current assist - total liabilities). These so-called net-nets are nowadays very rare and often disappear completely during market advances. \n\nAnother opportunity is that non-industry leaders go on sale during market declines. Staying away from small companies with investing buzzwords (electronic, computer, .com, EV, hydrogen) one can often find bargains there. \n\n#### Special Situations \n\nWith mergers, acquisitions and spin-offs opportunities arise for the enterprising investor. While arbitrage opportunities nearly disappeared and special situations are less profitable today than they were before due to specialized hedge funds, one can still create good returns. Joel Greenblatt with the book \u201cYou can be a stock market genius\u201d gives a great and easy to read introduction on how to profit from special situations. \n\n### Broader Implications for the aggressive investor\n\nTo be an aggressive investor one needs to have considerable knowledge of security values. One can start by analysing stocks and using a small part of the portfolio to evaluate his work. Since being an aggressive or enterprising investor is a lot of work, the majority should be defensive investors. Index funds have shown that one can achieve excellent returns by being passive. \n\nAndrew Carneggie said: \u201cPut all your eggs into one basket and then watch that basket\u201d. Warren Buffet and Ben Graham agree that big fortunes have been made by people who put their money into an investment they knew extremely well. Nearly all the richest people are concentrated, however being concentrated has risks during hard times. To stay on the Fortune 400 list from 1982 to 2002 one only needed a return of 4.5% annually (the stock market returned 13% and most treasury bonds or saving accounts yielded more than that), yet from 1982 to 2002 only 16% of the original 400 remained on the list.\n\nGraham outlines several rules: \n\nA margin of safety -  buying the stock for bargain prices (no more than two thirds of the appraisal value according to Graham) is one of the most important factors of being an investor.  Many professionals have proven that timing the market is impossible so one should not even try it. Stocks with high potential for hype have an even bigger one for disappointing investment returns. \n\nA great company is not a great investment if you pay too much for the stock.",

        "selftext": " \n\n## Chapter 8 The Investor and Market fluctuations\n\nI am summarizing and updating \u201cThe Intelligent Investor\u201d. If you have missed it here are the previous chapters: \n\n[Chapter 1: Investment vs Speculation](https://roiss.substack.com/p/lets-update-and-summarize-the-intelligent)\n\n[Chapter 2: Inflation and Investing](https://roiss.substack.com/p/lets-update-and-summarize-the-intelligent-5eb)\n\n[Chapter 3: Cycles and market psychology](https://roiss.substack.com/p/lets-update-and-summarize-the-intelligent-686)\n\n[Chapter 4&amp;5: Portfolio policy and stocks for the defensive investor](https://roiss.substack.com/p/lets-update-and-summarize-the-intelligent-e3a)\n\n[Chapter 6&amp;7: Portfolio policy and stocks for the aggressive investor](https://roiss.substack.com/p/the-intelligent-investor-portfolio)\n\n[Chapter 8 : The Investor and market fluctuations](https://roiss.substack.com/p/the-intelligent-investor-market-flucations)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWarren Buffet calls Chapter 8 and Chapter 20 the bedrock of his investing activities underlining the importance of this chapter. In it Ben Graham explains market fluctuations in a small anecdote.\n\nYou own a small share of the business. Your partner Mr Market tells you everyday what he thinks your share is worth. He offers to buy you out or to sell you additional shares. Sometimes his suggestions seem plausible justified by business developments and prospects. Often however Mr Market lets his enthusiasm or his fear run away and the price he proposes seem short of silly. If you are an intelligent investor you will not let Mr Market\u2019s daily communication determine your view of the company. You are happy to sell your shares when he quotes you a ridiculously high price and equally happy to buy when his price is depressed. But the rest of the time you will be wiser to value your holdings based on full reports from the company about it\u2019s operations and financial position. \n\nIf there is one certainty in the market it is that your portfolio holdings will fluctuate widely. One can expect his holdings to go up or down 50% once in the next five years. An investor wants to take advantage of these fluctuations, but it creates the danger to start speculating. It is easy to write about not speculating. It is much harder to follow that advice when the enthusiasm and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) sets in. \n\n### Market fluctuations as a guide to investment decisions\n\nThere are two ways to profit from market fluctuations: timing and pricing. \n\nTiming is when you buy and expect an upward swing, while pricing is to buy stocks below their fair value and sell them when they reach that value. \n\nIf you emphasize timing you it will only lead to speculation. No one can forecast the future. Analysts are more often than not wrong (look at forecasts for the years that had a market crash in them) but we get convinced that forecasts are important. \n\nOf course some people can make good money with market forecasting and \u201cmacro investing\u201d (like Ray Dalio) but the general public won\u2019t. Instead one can use timing as a psychological advantage. Every speculator wants to get rich quickly and most professional money managers get rated on their quarterly performance. The idea to wait a year is repugnant. If you have a long term outlook with good financial fundamentals that can be a huge advantage. \n\n### \u201cEasy Money\u201d\n\nIf you spent any time in 2020 on social media you have seen them too: people who promise to make easy money with a stock picking system, formulas or an option strategy. It sounds great, but Ben Graham warns of those schemes:  Any approach to money making in the stock market which can be easily described and followed by a lot of people is by it\u2019s terms too simple and too easy to last. \n\nIf you look at the returns of the best investors of all time Spinoza comes to mind: \u201cAll things excellent are as difficult as they are rare.\u201d\n\n### Market fluctuations and the investors portfolio\n\nDay-to-day or even month-to-month fluctuations won\u2019t make you richer or poorer. While a rise in the market brings confidence and a good feeling that can lead to overconfidence, enthusiasm and greed. Even for the intelligent investor it takes considerable willpower to keep oneself from following the crowd. \n\nIf you listen to financial tv or are on social media you think investing is a sport or war game. But it is not about beating others but about controlling yourself at your own game. \n\nOften it is better to not look at the market quotation but just read the financial reports of the companies. Instead of thinking like a trader, one should think like a business owner. While speculators try to profit from market fluctuations you should just aim to acquire a company at a good price. Never buy a stock because it has gone up or sell because it has gone down.\n\nGraham summarized it perfectly: \u201cThe primary cause of failure is that they pay too much attention to what the stock market is doing.\u201d \n\n### Business valuations vs stock market valuations \n\nWhat the stock\u2019s value is should be based on its balance sheet and financial strength. However because of trading they are often seen as stock symbols instead of a business. That makes them more dependent on market movements and less on the business financials. \n\nGood businesses are likely to sell above book value and the better it's record and prospects are the farther it is removed from intrinsic value. It depends more on the changing moods of the investors. Loses of big companies are often due to a lack of confidence in the premium valuation that the stock market has placed. Graham advics to concentrate on issues that are selling at a reasonably close approximation to tangible asset value as they have more correlation to the balance sheet. Now a stock is not a good investment because it was bought at asset value and with the rise of software and more asset-light companies this advice shouldn\u2019t be taken literally. No matter what, the company\u2019s valuation should be based on reality and not on hopes and dreams. \n\n### Market psychology \n\nHumans perceive trends where they do not exist and we have tendencies to buy high and sell low.  If you are aware of these biases you can keep yourself in check and can have great investment returns. The book called \u201cThinking fast and slow\u201d outlines these biases and Charlie Munger gave a great talk about the human misjudgements that can definitely help to improves one's investing behaviour. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqzcCfUglws",

        "selftext": "When it comes to discussing a company\u2019s financial performance, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), has become such a common reference point that you would think that everyone embraces its utility. However, neither Warren Buffett, nor Charlie Munger, who famously said \u201cI think that, every time you see the word EBITDA, you should substitute the words \u2018bullshit earnings,\u2019\u201d have much good to say about the acronym. Buffett has even gone so far as to call its widespread use a \u201cmass delusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn respect to EBITDA, depreciation is an expense, and it\u2019s the worst kind of an expense,\u201d Warren Buffett said at the 2017 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting. \u201cYou know, we love to talk about float. And float is where we get the money first and we have the expense later. Depreciation is where you spend the money first, you know, and, then, record the expense later. And it\u2019s reverse float. And it\u2019s not a good thing. And to have that enter into a multiple, it\u2019s much better to buy a business that has, everything else being equal, has no depreciation because it has, essentially, no investment and fixed assets that makes X, than it is to buy a company where there\u2019s a lot of depreciation in getting to X\u2026And, of course, it\u2019s in the interests of Wall Street, enormously, to focus on something called EBITDA because it results in higher borrowing power, higher valuations, and all of that sort of thing. So it\u2019s become very popular in the last 20 years\u2026.It\u2019s a very misleading statistic that can be used in very pernicious ways.\u201d\n\n**See** **Buffett\u2019s full explanation on EBITDA and depreciation**\n\n[https://mazorsedge.com/lessons-from-warren-buffett-why-depreciation-is-the-worst-kind-of-expense/](https://mazorsedge.com/lessons-from-warren-buffett-why-depreciation-is-the-worst-kind-of-expense/)",

That\u2019s not true in investments,\u201d Warren Buffett said at the 1998 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting. \u201cYou get paid just as well for the most simple dive, as long as you execute it all right. And there\u2019s no reason to try those three-and-a-halves when you get paid just as well for just diving off the side of the pool and going in cleanly.

        "title": "A few interesting ideas to consider",
        "selftext": "A few simple changes to investing that I picked up over the years that you could think about. \n\n1. Look at stocks when markets are closed. This way if you sell or buy on impulse you have to wait until the next day and potentially get back to your senses and correct your mistake if needed. Look at your stocks as little as possible. Small changes are meaningless. It\u2019s all about the big picture. Looking at stocks constantly may give us the impression that we have control yet the sun will keep on shining with us or without us and the people we invest in will keep on doing their job whether we watch them do it or not. Heck, farmers don\u2019t watch each and every one of their seeds grow each minute of the day. It\u2019s just a shortcut to insanity.\n\n2. Ask yourself if the stock\u2019s price is cheap in absolute terms and not in relation to future forecasts and sentiment. \n\n3. If a stock is down, don\u2019t sell until one or two years have passed. Again this is to protect you again impulsiveness. \n\n4. If you don\u2019t like tomato sauce with basilica in it, turn on grayscale when checking your portfolios. \n\n5. Before making an investment, ask yourself if you\u2019re being humble about it. Sometimes we can get into an ego trip thinking that *we* are right about a stock pick because we\u2019ve been analysing it a lot and thus know better than anyone else. Remember that the stock market doesn\u2019t give 2 cents about us and we\u2019re not special. (Fight Club)\n\n6. Live more. A good investor should live strive to live a fulfilling life. Don\u2019t just read finance and investment-related books. Expand your mind beyond that. Meet people (take your covid precautions), go for a hike, disappear for a week to visit a new place, heck even take up meditation. Whatever it is, expand yourself and your horizons because your wealth will keep on increasing without your assistance but your mind, spirit, happiness and body won\u2019t unless you focus on them as well. \n\n7. Remember to follow your gut. Don\u2019t invest money you will need in a few weeks, months or years. Make sure you have money left for other activities in life. Your gut will tell you when you\u2019re investing too much money at once. If I\u2019m not mistaken and remember my readings, the brain developed way after our gut so it shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. (Don\u2019t confuse gut with emotions). If you can\u2019t sleep tight with your current investment strategy you should rethink it. \n\n8. Remember that you are your worst enemy. To the contrary of what economists blabber, we\u2019re not rational most of the time so steps should be taken to counter our irrationality. Studies show that our mind is incredible at, in a way, interpreting reality as it pleases more than we realise. It can overfocus on certain aspect, negative or positive, which bias our good judgment. Remember that there\u2019s a study that actually showed that portfolios of people who either forgot about having invested or who died have performed the best as they simply hadn\u2019t fiddled with their portfolio nor sold anything out because the sell button suddenly felt like a rash that needed to be itched. \n\n9. Remain unbiased as long as possible. Start by reading the reports first before listening to what people have to say about the company. We have a natural tendency to love our first ideas and take ideas coming from people more seriously which can thus bias us towards liking a stock when we didn\u2019t really look into the facts ourselves. If a friend wants to share an investing idea tell them to either email the idea to you or to meet up another time to discuss the company when you\u2019ll be on the same level as them. This way you\u2019ll be able to have an educated opinion on the company as well and avoid being biased towards liking it based on your friends liking of it. \n\n10. Don\u2019t try to be smart. It is easier trying to avoid being stupid. \n\nI\u2019d be interested in hearing your insights as well.\n\nThank you for reading. \n\nStoitician",

        "selftext": "Hi here I want to tell you about what I think is the most undervalued stock right now. It can be a huge value play here\u2019s why:\n\nGROWTH : 37% yoy in revenues, cloud business with now positive Ebita and growing at 50%.\n\nThe company operates in the online-retail market (mainly) in China, which is expected to grow its GDP and surpass the USA in 2028.\n\nDebt and Moat: Low debt, can pay all its debt with cash, so it can be considered a financial fortress as Buffett uses to say.\n\nAlibaba has definitely a moat with can be seen from different points of view:\n\n1) Network effect = The fact that the 53% of online- retail sales is from Alibaba and its platform creates a continuous increase in the number of users.\n\n2)Barriers to entry= In this market there are only few players becoming a sort of oligopoly.\n\n3)Economies of scale= Alibaba has shown its ability to scale, and so to increase its revenues without decreasing its profit margins, and it is able to grow and at the same time to reduce the \u201cper-product-cost\u201d.\n\n4) Substitution costs= Alibaba operates with online- salers which probably have made investments in order to position themselves in the Alibaba platforms, and it could be a huge cost to change platform.\n\nPRICE: Alibaba trades at 25/26 PE, forward PE of  20. And here nothing else to say. Considered the future growth is very cheap.\n\nWHY IT IS UNDERVALUED: It is undervalued because market hates uncertainty and I think that the market fears are \n\nA) Usa-China relationships\n\nB)CCP, because it is mainly a dictatorship and for example the ccp can do whatever he whats with its companies and population\n\n\u2014&gt; WHY THE MARKET IS MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE: \n\nCCP is in continuous competition with USA, and I think that it will never destroy his \u201cdiamond tips - companies like BABA or Tencent.\n\nCCP ,as Charlie Munger said at BRK annual meeting in Los Angeles, has discovered the \u201cformula\u201d that is a form of economic-regulated capitalism.\n\nFor these reasons I think baba is hugely undervalued and as its fair price could be 320/330$ per ADR share.\n\nP.S.\nSorry for my English, I am Italian\ud83d\ude02",

        "selftext": "I really became interested in investing about 2 years ago and I was immediately drawn to value investing. I read Graham, Peter Lynch, Phil Fisher, other books on valuation. I've watched tons of interviews with Buffet, Munger, Joel Greenblatt, and Mohnish Pabrai. I've spent hours reading SEC filings, creating spread sheets to track and value companies, reading posts on this forum, reading investor letters, etc., etc. etc. I've probably spent 10-15 hours a week learning about investing and researching for the last 2 years.\n\nAll along, every time I decided to buy a company I would have a decent idea of the general characteristics of the business, what the management thought, what the valuation should be, but I still felt like I was pretty much guessing at things. I always thought, this looks like a decent company in a decent sector, I think they are maybe somewhat under-priced and if they can keep doing what they are doing now, they may grow. I'll buy them and hope it turns out.\n\nThis changed recently when I stumbled across a business that I can truly understand. The business is fairly simple and is within my circle of competence and what I realized is that every other business I was looking at was either A) not within my circle of competence or B) did not include a sufficient margin of safety (not sure you can determine B without A). I think I was deluding myself that these other companies I was researching were really within my circle of competence, but now I realize they were not. Even though I may have understood these businesses on a superficial level, I did not understand them well enough to know, with a very high degree of certainty, that if I bought into the company I would see a positive return on my investment. \n\nIn my mind, without truly understanding the businesses, there was always the doubt that the company could fail or a sector could have a downturn and in 10 years my investment would be worth less than it is today. Now I'm starting to feel that if a business is really within your circle of competence and you buy it with a margin of safety, there really isn't any doubt. You feel like you have a sure thing. I'm also learning that it is extremely rare for an investment to meet both these criteria. I will be lucky if I find 1 more that falls in my circle of competence and has a margin of safety in the next 2 years.",

        "title": "How to hedge against inflation Michael Burry style",
        "selftext": " \n\nThis is a portion of some of my recent inflation DD from researching Michael Burry/Scion's recent 13F plays. I thought it was an interesting investing strategy and wanted to share it here in case anyone is interested. There's more research over on [r/Burryology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/) (specifically [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/nepc7l/the_bull_is_gasping_major_themes_from_michael/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)).\n\n***Inflation, inflation, inflation! (21%+ of current holdings)***\n\nIf you've been following [r/Burryology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/) since its inception many eons ago (a little over a month ago), you likely guessed that the next 13F would reveal Burry's strategy for hedging and/or profiting off of the inflation situation. Would he buy/hold REITs as the hedge? What about gold, oil, and other commodities? Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)?\n\nWe now have the answer.\n\nHere are the direct inflation plays:\n\n*Put options on* [***Ishares 20+ year treasury bond etf (TLT)***](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp) *-* *12.7% of current holdings*\n\n*Probable Burry thesis:* rising inflation over the mid- to long-term will lead to the need to increase interest rates thus making these 20 year bonds less attractive.\n\n*Some context:* The U.S. Treasury announced plans to start issuing 20-year treasury bonds in January 2020. The benefits to 20 year treasury bonds are that they're relatively safe, their value could increase if interest rates drop, and they're relatively liquid. The cons are that they're over a 20 year period (meaning you lock in very low interest rates at which you get paid), inflation may occur over that 20 year period and lead to an increase in interest rates that you'll miss out on, and rising interest rates in general hurt the value of these bonds ([link](https://www.mybanktracker.com/blog/investing/20-year-treasury-bonds-307834)).\n\n*Call options on* [*Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treasury etf (TBT)*](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/TBT/profile) *- 4.1%*\n\nProbable Burry thesis: this is the same 20+ year treasury bond mentioned above so the strategy is likely the same. The difference here is that it's a call on an inverse bond ETF.\n\n*Context:* The ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index. (from Zacks article linked above).\n\n*Put options on Ishares* [russell 2000 growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/russell2000.asp) *etf (IWO) - 3.1%*\n\n*Probably Burry thesis:* There are two possibilities here. One is that the Russell 2000 is overpriced having outperformed the S&amp;P 500 at 81% vs 43% since last May. The other is that inflation will lead to a recession that does actual damage to the economy which effectively makes a short on the Russell 2000 a bet against the overall economy.\n\n*Context:* The Russell 2000 index measures the performance of the 2000 smaller companies that are included in the Russell 3000 index which itself is made up of nearly all U.S. stocks. It is seen as a bellwether of the American economy because it measures the performance of smaller businesses focused on the domestic market. It's considered more cyclical than the larger indexes which is to say that it follows the economy tightly.\n\n*Others:*\n\n1. *Shares of* *Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treasury etf (TBT) - 0.5%*\n2. *Call options on Proshares ultrapro short 20 + year t (TTT)*\n\n***Out with the REITs***\n\nOne of the more interesting observations from Scion's Q4 2020 13F was a sleuth of positions in various REITs. He had a little over 17% of the portfolio in REITs:\n\n* Uniti Group Inc - 3.98% (now 0%)\n* The GEO Group Inc - 3.51% (now 0%)\n* RPT Realty - 4.05% (now 0.5%)\n* Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc - 2.81% (now 0.1%)\n* CoreCivic Inc - 3.07% (overall net increase in the total position, now 0.7%)\n\nIn Q1 2021, REITs accounted for just 1.3% of Scion's holdings. He exited out of Uniti and GEO, trimmed Urstadt and RPT Realty, and increased the CoreCivic position. All-in-all, it seems he's bearish on REITs serving as the best vehicle for profiting off of inflation compared to shorting the 20 year treasury bond.",

Value investing is an adaptable and constantly evolving concept, not a rigid doctrine that remains intact over time.\n\nValue investing consists of understanding stocks as part of businesses with an underlying value, having a long-term vision and using a margin of safety to minimize risk, but all this is subject to multiple interpretations and adapts to the personality of the investor. Buffett is different from Graham, Lynch is different from Buffett, David Tepper is different from Lynch, and Bill Ackman is different from Tepper, but they all have value investing at the center of their common philosophy.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that for a company to be technological, have high growth, a large amount of intangible assets and a high multiple, it does not mean that it is not a good option in the value parameters, and that a company that trades at few Multiples of its book value do not mean that it is attractive or cheap.",

We\u2019re going to discuss Michael Burry\u2019s New Put position against $TSLA. In recent Q1 of 2021 fillings Scion Asset Management disclosed they\u2019re $500Million Put position in Tesla. Burry is betting against Tesla but don\u2019t confuse *PUT with a SHORT* the question is what\u2019s causing this move?\n\nLets start from the beginning For Michael Burry he\u2019s been advocating the upcoming inflation Since early 2021 on his twitter account \n\n**ABOUT INFLATION**\n\nas of today commodities have been rising for the past 12months, lumber prices are significantly up, Housing market is seeing a big growth, Global food prices rose for the 12th month in a row in May, up nearly 40% YOY. Numbers do like inflationary \n\n[Wages are rising](http://www.cnn.com/2021/05/18/economy/bank-of-america-minimum-wage/index.html) and so are [bond yields](https://money.cnn.com/data/bonds/index.html). The housing market is still chugging along. The [prices of many retail goods](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/09/investing/stocks-week-ahead/index.html) are going up, partly because of [supply shortages](http://www.cnn.com/2021/05/15/business/supply-chain-price-increases/index.html) but also because of real demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Relationship between Inflation, higher interest rates, and stocks**  \n\nWhen anticipating higher inflation rates central banks have the tools to prevent this from happening and one way is to raise interest rates, but higher rates do have both pros and cons. But for our research lets just discuss how this affects stocks and particularly growth stock\n\nHere's a screenshot from Visualcapitalist to demonstrate the following \n\nhttps://advisor.visualcapitalist.com/how-rising-treasury-yields-impact-your-portfolio/\n\nHigh rates and Stocks \n\nLet\u2019s take the period of the 1960\u2019s-1980\u2019s DJIA where the index advanced from 618 to 875 during 20year period, but on the other hand in the same time frame U.S. GDP grew by 370%. What caused such asymmetrical movements between general stock market and whole GDP? Answer lies in interest rates  Picture \n\nhttps://advisor.visualcapitalist.com/us-interest-rates/ \n\n  During the period of 1960-1980 **10year treasury yield** went from 4% to staggering 15% by 1980. To put things into perspective let\u2019s talk in pre-tax terms suppose you\u2019ve bought:\n\n$1M worth of bonds paying you 10% annually.\n\nthis means every year you are producing $100.000 pre-tax which is really good. Now let\u2019s say that you want to buy a *business* that\u2019s earning $100.000 pre-tax what is the amount you are willing to pay? well that depends our bond which is virtually risk-free yields 10% return every year for the next 10yrs in pre-tax terms, \n\nif considering buying a business paying more than 1Million won\u2019t be an intelligent thing to do say you buy a business worth 1.5M making 100k pre-tax the return would be 6.7%. making an investment decision investor is better off with bonds in given example than he is with given business. Not many businesses can return say 10-15% annually for span of 8-10yrs. in period of 1980\u2019s bonds were superior pick as compared to stocks.\n\nAs said inflation causes interest rates to move higher and this leads us to market sentiment swaying away from stocks to fixed investments paying higher yield. And vice versa as Warren Buffett said \u2018\u2019the effect of interest rate changes is usually obscured. Nonetheless, the effect--like the invisible pull of gravity--is constantly there\u2019\u2019. \n\n  Since we established the basic frame in which this letter is written, now let\u2019s get back to burry\n\nAs we said raising inflation causes interest rates to go up and stock prices to go down, some companies have high exposure to inflation and some don\u2019t. by  experience and many examples we know that inflation hurts growth stocks more than their older peers why? Most of the time high growth tech companies are trading based on future performance, valuations are based on revenue multiples and sizes of the enterprise, newly baked companies don\u2019t produce any free cash flow. this type of environment is sustainable at low interest rates since everyone is better of buying a speculative security $XYZ for price of say 50$ that has high trading volume that is likely trade at 100$ in this type of environment high growths are simply better performing group than older peers and fixed investments. \n\nWhat happens when there are risks of inflation kicking in? well most likely general public will shift their attention to \u2018safer\u2019\u2019 securities that have less **exposure to inflation risks** case can be made for companies that have pricing power to delegate rising costs by raising prices (mature companies for example) or fixed investment securities.  We can argue that there are other hedges against inflation but are more suited for sophisticated individual\n\nAs of June5, 2021 what\u2019s the big picture? Inflation could be both transitory or here to stay I don\u2019t think Its in my competence to guess the macro environment and therefore I won\u2019t. \n\nAs described earlier inflation followed by higher interest rates causes the general public to shift from high growth stocks to safer investments, this has double effect \u2018\u2019safer\u2019\u2019 company stock prices are on the rise and growth companies with unsustainable multiples and add public opinion shifting away from the business given securities price tends to go down. \nreason is growth companies are more dependent on borrowing money to fuel growth, and higher interest rates make that more expensive leading to slower growth and the possibility of those large borrowings crushing their business.\n\nIn case of Michael burry and his conviction about upcoming inflation mixed with bearish view on TESLA explains his move. As we know betting against Tesla in 2020wasn\u2019t a smart move to make(source S3) \n\n  [https://imgur.com/EW5ydel](https://imgur.com/EW5ydel)\n\nTesla short sellers lost about $40Billion dollars in 2020 so betting against it just because it trades at high multiples or is cash low negative isn\u2019t a sufficient argument to bet against it there *should be more factors interacting with each other in order to bet against Tesla.  As of 2021 we have the following picture* \n\n**Almost unjustifiable trading multiples, Internal company problems such as supply-chain issues, accompanied by China operations pressures, in mix with external factor of inflation followed up by rising bond yields makes the company somewhat vulnerable as compared to previous year.** \n\nand if you are still here thank you for your time!\n\nMayer Weinroth",

        "title": "Accounting problems: How to spot accounting inconsistencies",
        "selftext": "I have written the following summary with sources mainly from aswath damodaran. Hopefully it helps.\n\n## Background\n\nThe advanced accounting system was developed during the industrial revolution for manufacturing firms and since economies are shifting away from manufacturing to technology and service related businesses, accountants have had a tough job keeping up, you will see many inconsistencies reflect the shift away in the economy. Accounting created during a very different century with a different economy.\n\n## Taxes\n\nTax in the income statement might not match up to what the company pays out as taxes. So that difference shows up as a deferred tax and builds up over time either as an asset or liabilities.\n\nOn a company\u2019s balance sheet, deferred tax [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredtaxasset.asp) &amp; [liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredtaxliability.asp) are reflections of expectations of taxes in the future or due for the current period.\u00a0\n\nFor example, if it's a money losing company, it obviously doesn't pay taxes (maybe that could change under the recent G7/French big tech revenue tax proposals for big companies, who knows). It also allows us to take those losses and carry them forward/backwards. You are allowed to take that loss and set it off against the income in a future year.\n\n* So one of the things to look at is to determine whether there\u2019s a [Net Operating Loss (NOL)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netoperatingloss.asp) and;\n* secondly, how much that NOL is; because it will affect your tax payments in the future.\n\nTaxes that are paid in the income statement might not reflect what the company actually pays but the giveaway would be to look in the cash flow statement because it will reflect the difference. So combining a cash flow statement with an income statement will give a sense of taxes.\n\n## Stock based compensation\n\nSome companies pay stock compensation to give employees an incentive to align them with the company, i.e a lot of the FAANG companies do this to align employees to the companies goals.\n\nAlso, if the company cannot afford (for not having enough cash) to pay salaries to their employees, then they pay with stock (giving away a piece of their company). This mostly occurs in startups though.\n\nTo the extent that you\u2019re paying with stock to keep employees working for you, it has to be treated as an employee compensation thus means that it\u2019s an operating expense.  \n\nIn 2004, the rules changed for granted options as they were treated as giving away nothing because accountants valued options as [exercise value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp). By looking at the income statements in US/EU companies, if companies do give employees compensation in the form of stocks/options then it will show a line item and that line item reflects the value of the grant at the time of the grant. So it is an operating expense and not a cash flow.\u00a0\n\nWhen computing the cash flows for a company, we should not be adding back stock based compensation because you are giving away a slice of the equity which will not be attributable to shareholders. The rule now is that if you grant with stock it\u2019s going to be treated as an expense which is the correct way.\n\n## Leases\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the company took the 10-year lease and the contract requires the company to make lease payments every year for the next 10 years. This is called contractual commitment and what that means is that the company has to pay in good and bad years. Because it's a fixed payment where your business will cease to exist if you don\u2019t pay the lease it\u2019s essentially a form of debt and should be treated as such.\n\nThe accountants made the ownership the center of their decision making, if you don\u2019t have an ownership of an asset, they will not treat these lease commitments as debt. The latter were called operating leases. In 2019, US companies show capital leases as debt and operating leases as operating expenses. In non-US companies, all these lease commitments are often treated as operating lease expenses. So financing expenses were treated as an operating expense. A good example of this was Spirit Airlines 10K in 2020. It looked healthy on the balance sheets but in the footnotes it has a huge amount of leases attributable to Boeing that it was hiding.\n\n&gt;A new **FASB** rule, effective Dec. 15, 2018, requires that all **leases**\u2014unless they are shorter than **12 months**\u2014must be recognized on the balance sheet.\n\nNow all lease commitments are treated as debt (unless they are less than 12 months). When you do the computation, make sure that all leases are treated as debt in your valuations including &lt; 12 month leases. Otherwise your balance sheet won\u2019t be balanced.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nIf you have an expense that creates benefits and generates future growth over many years, it\u2019s a capital expense. If you have an expense that creates only this year, it\u2019s an operating expense. So, R&amp;D should be treated as [capital expenditures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp) (CAPEX) even though they are not by accountants.\n\nTo compute the R&amp;D:\n\n1. specify an amortizable life, how many years does it take;\n2. collect R&amp;D from past years. Let\u2019s say it's been spread out over 5 years. How much of that expense is being written off this year and how much is still left over. The amount that\u2019s being written off this year will be amortized will show up as an expense; the amount that\u2019s not been written off from previous years will now show up in the balance sheet (capital invested in R&amp;D);\n3. then you have to adjust your earnings, so that the entire perspective on a company can change by making those shifts. Ifa we do not do R&amp;D, we are going to get an\u00a0asymmetrical vision of what these businesses are worth, how much the company is investing and what they are truly making.\n\nSource: *Accounting 101 by Aswath Damodaran.*\n\nMy DCF calculator does all this for you (R&amp;D coming soon), check out the iRobot example using our [Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) calculator](https://tracktak.com/stock/irbt-us/discounted-cash-flow?cagrInYears_1_5=0.18&amp;ebitTargetMarginInYear_10=0.1&amp;yearOfConvergence=3&amp;salesToCapitalRatio=2.5) or do your own [here](https://tracktak.com/).\n\nOr for more content you can join r/tracktak\n\nThanks",

        "title": "Are Reddit Traders Being Manipulated?",
        "selftext": "I can\u2019t help to notice how many popular stocks recently have been following a pattern of manipulation, particularly $GEO and $WISH. Their pattern is distinctly different from the manic buying that happened early on with $GME.\n\nWith $GME the behavior was that traders bought shares over a period of many days. This can be seen in the rise and fall of the stock over a period of well over a week (Jan 21 - Feb 4 2021). This makes a lot of sense as retail investors generally are not constantly making trades and don\u2019t even possess software to issue fast trades (most brokers have a delay in order execution). This is what I\u2019d expect if a stock is being manipulated by a group of people, coordinating actions takes time and no everyone is a professional trader.\n\nWith $WISH and $GEO, we see a different pattern (although both were pumped on Reddit). Here, there is a fast rise and a fast fall over the course of 1 day. Interestingly enough both rallies end at market close when they started. The next day the rallies mysteriously die and both stocks return to normal. If both were being pumped by a group of independent individuals, I just don\u2019t see how such a pattern would emerge, especially if the individuals were not already seasoned traders (which the general public is not).\n\nWhy is this highly suspicious?\nFirst both rallies end at day end. This is setting a perfect trap for individual investors who are not constantly checking the market. With such a strong rally the general public is bound to believe that the rally will continue on the next day. Also, they\u2019re likely to check the news at the end of the day.\n\nHow could an attacker profit?\nBy planning the date in advance, one or many attackers can simply buy low priced options for the given date at the expected strike price. By coordinating a mass buying (GEO and WISH have relatively low volume and market cap), the attacker can raise the price (especially due to mark to market). His options would substantially rise in price, which he could unload at a hefty profit. By selling the stock to the general public the day after the rally, the price would go back down (again, most of the general public is unlikely to quickly sell, hence the price would go back to what it was). The attacker makes a hefty profit on the options, and likely no loss (maybe even a profit) on the stock. I estimate that 200M would be able to easily make such moves for both GEO and WISH. 200M is not an insane amount for a fund.\n\nBoth rallies look extremely suspicious to me, what do folks think?",

Looking forward to being active here as I know there are lots of new investors that I want to help teach what I've learned.\n\nOne of the things I see most on Reddit are people trying to out-think each other in terms of identifying complex business models/situations, over-guessing their near-term future, which is then (sadly) perceived as the only way to outperform.\n\nThat is just not true, and candidly, may lead you to some bad decisions.\n\nI titled this post a quote from Peter Lynch because I think it paints the truest way of thinking when it comes to investing. As Buffett has said, investing is not competition diving where the hardest to achieve dive is awarded the top score. Therefore, it is not the complexity of your idea that will grant you your gains, it is how well you are able to handle volatility and stay true to your original story. (A lot easier said than done)\n\nAll of this to say is don't try to outthink yourself or even others.

        "title": "PSTH is a no brainer at current price.",
        "selftext": "For those who don't know, PSTH is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) created by legendary value investor Bill Ackman. Recently, Bill announced an amazing deal that I will explain below. For each share of PSTH, you buy you will get:\n\n**1 share of Universal Music Group:**\n\nThis costs $14.75 per PSTH share. Bill bought 10% of UMG at a valuation of $42.4 billion. Goldman Sachs recently valued UMG at $53 Billion, and Bank of America just valued UMG at $59 Billion. If UMG trades near these new valuations, this $14.75 share will be worth \\~$19-20.\n\n**UMG has a Huge Moat/Significant Barriers to Entry**\n\nEverybody loves music, and record labels are the leeches of the music industry. Unethical? Maybe. Good for PSTH investors? Absolutely. Take a look at the names of Universal Music Group artists (Drake, Kanye, Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, and the Beatles to name just a few. To reiterate, we own the fucking Beatles!) [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_Universal\\_Music\\_Group\\_artists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Universal_Music_Group_artists)\n\n**1 share of PSTH**:\n\nThat's right, you get another company! Bill only used $4 Billion of the cash he had, leaving him with $1.5 Billion for RemainCo (the remaining company). $5.25 of each PSTH share will be allocated for this RemainCo.  It's almost impossible to speculate what company this will be, although r/PSTH thinks that it's Plaid or Impossible Foods, so it's almost certainly neither (jk love y'all). When will this company be announced? Once again, it's hard to say. Bill has known about this deal structure since November, giving him 7 months to find targets/negotiate deals. After 6/22 (date of vote by Vivendi shareholders to finalize the UMG deal) , Bill will be allowed to discuss ALL of this in more depth, and maybe even give us an announcement for RemainCo.\n\n**1 SPAR:**\n\nThis is the icing on the cake. 1 SPAR gives you the right to purchase SPARC which is PSTH 2 at NAV ($20). Bill has $6-10.6 Billion to purchase \\~10% of a huge company, and with SPARC you get access to the pre-IPO Price. You can only exercise these SPARs after SPARC enters a Definitive Agreement with a company. So unlike SPACs, with SPA**R**C, there is no opportunity cost. With SPAR, you have the opportunity to invest at NAV only after you know what the company is.\n\nNot only that, but Bill also recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1401376625401470977) that PSTH shareholders will get access to ALL future SPARCS at NAV. Just imagine if he does like 5-10 SPARCs over the next decade. This could potentially be the most valuable part of this deal, but for now, I'll say 1 SPAR + Warrants is worth $5 because it's super hard to estimate.\n\n**2/9 Warrants:**\n\nI don't want to go too much into depth on this, but you get at least 2 warrants per 9 shares held through the merger. More info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSTH/wiki/index)\n\n**So, what's PSTH's value?**\n\n$20 (UMG)+ $5.25(RemainCo) +$5(SPAR+Warrants) = $30.25.\n\nAt the time of this post, PSTH is trading at around $22.50 which is significantly undervalued at the moment IMO.\n\nShoutout to the tontards over at r/PSTH much of this is just reiterating their analysis. There's some really excellent DD on UMG over there if you're interested.",

        "title": "Financial Ratios and Screeners - Cheat Sheet for new folks.",
        "selftext": "Personally I consider myself a growth investor, but I care about value metrics to invest with a margin of safety and avoid hype-traps. Here are some practical tools to assist when valuing companies before considering an investment.\n\n**First, some definitions:**\n\nMarket Cap = # of shares * price of a share. The total value of a company.\n\nEnterprise Value (EV) = market cap - cash on hand + debts. If you were to buy out the whole company this is what it would cost you. (May be more useful than market cap because it isn't distorted by debt levels.)\n\n**Value investing** to me means thinking of a stock as ownership in an ongoing business (rather than just a ticker that moves up and down in price), valuing that business in terms of its future cash flows, and investing at a price where you have a margin of safety in case your estimated value of the business was inaccurate.\n\n### Valuation Metrics:\n\nSome of these are easily displayed on various financial sites; others may require you to look into a company's balance sheet and build a spreadsheet yourself to calculate them. I'm writing this up to provide some of the intuition behind the numbers.\n\n- **Price/Earnings (P/E)**: everyone knows this one, including company managers, and there's strong motivation to \"game\" earnings through various tactics. Low P/E is the market expressing low expectations for future earnings growth. Buying low P/E stocks simply because they're \"cheap\" can drop you into value traps which are cheap for a good reason.\n\nTypically Earnings will refer to past (trailing twelve months) earnings; you may instead want to consider future, projected Earnings. But sometimes projections are wrong.\n\n- **Price/Sales Ratio (P/S)**: earnings are easy to manipulate but sales figures, less so. A low P/S ratio means a company sells a lot relative to its market cap; it's possible they're not making much money because their operating margins are poor. If you think a company has the ability to improve profit margins, low P/S may find you a good value. [See Ken Fisher's old book, Super Stocks, for a full case about why low P/S is a good screen].\n\n- **Price/Book (P/B)**: book value is measure of a company's assets if added up by an accountant (often meaning original purchase price). Old Ben Graham \"net-nets\" would screen for book value to look for companies with more assets than enterprise value - worth more dead than alive - as ultimate margin of safety. However, those are basically never found these days, and with assets being increasingly brand names or other intangibles, book value is less meaningful. EXCEPTION: comparing bank stocks, where book is (basically) the amount of deposit assets the bank has to work with; P/B &gt; 2 for a bank is \"expensive\", P/B &lt; 1 for a bank is \"cheap\" (or means they're in deep shit). \n\n- **Acquirer's Multiple**: Enterprise Value/Operating Earnings. If you were to buy the company, how costly is it to acquire a dollar of operating earnings? (Lower is better; right now, &lt;10 is cheap). Popularized by Tobias Carlisle, you can easily use this screener at www.acquirersmultiple.com\n\n- **Cash Flow Yield**: Free Cash Flow/Enterprise Value. (Look up elsewhere how to calculate FCF). FCF represents how much a company can potentially return to shareholders, either as dividends/buybacks or investment in future growth, after paying necessary expenses to keep running. As a personal screen, I want to see a FCF Yield equal to 20-year Treasury Yield plus some risk premium. Less than 2% FCF Yield is non-investible to me personally.\n\n### Profitability Metrics\n\nThese are useful metrics to avoid stocks that are cheap because they're shitty businesses (value traps).\n\n- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: how much profit is generated for each shareholder dollar. As a rule of thumb, earnings growth can never exceed ROE (although high ROE is no guarantee of growth). Will be higher for companies with a lot of debt on the balance sheet, something to be aware of when doing comparisons.\n\n- **Return on Assets**: profit relative to book value. Higher is better. Multiply this by leverage to get ROE.\n\n- **ROIC**: factors in both debt and equity for ability to generate profits (it's a bit complicated). Importantly, is meaningless when looking at financial stocks.\n\n- Return on Capital Employed: Operating Earnings/(Assets - Current Liabilities). A screen I personally use as a rough-and-ready ROIC.\n\n- **Magic Formula**: popularized by Joel Greenblatt \"Little Book that Beats the Market\". Idea being a company with a low valuation combined with high profitability. See www.magicformulainvesting.com\n\nJust like there are value traps with P/E ratios, there can be \"efficiency traps\" with high ROICs; companies which dominate their niche and have good operations but are not growing. The best possible company will have high ROIC and also rapidly growing earnings, because they are applying efficient practices to a larger and larger market (these are rare to find at bargain prices). \n\nA cyclical company at the peak of its cycle may have great ROIC but will not sustain it; you can use gurufocus.com to look at the past few year's ROIC. Very high ROICs will invite competitors and decline over time; a long period of high ROIC probably indicates a competitive moat.\n\n### Screens you can Use\n\nI've collected various screens from books I've read, other experimentation, etc. Here they are for your consumption. If you get too many/few results, tinker with the numbers a little up or down. (It should go without saying, but a company showing up from a screener does not necessarily make it a good investment.)\n\n*[For all screens I will typically begin with: Domestic Only, NYSE or NASDAQ exchange (no OTC), Market Cap &gt; 1 Billion.]*\n\n- **Ghetto Magic Formula Screen**: No Real Estate or Utilities; ROIC Highest 20% of Industry; P/E lowest 20% of Industry.\n\n- **Graham's Enterprising Screen**: Current Ratio &gt; 1.5; Price/Book &lt; 2; EPS Growth last 5 years &gt; 15%; Debt/Equity &lt; 1.\n\n- **Motley Fool Screen**: Revenue Growth Last 5 Years &gt; 15%; EPS Growth most recent quarter vs. 1 year ago &gt; 10%; Net Profit Margin &gt; 15%; ROE &gt; 15%; Debt/Equity &lt; 0.5; Current Ratio &gt; 1.\n\n- **Munger Screen**: EPS Growth Last 5 Years &gt; 10%; ROE &gt; 15%; Current Ratio &gt; 1.5; Debt/Equity &lt; 0.5; Price &gt; $9; P/E &lt; 21.\n\n- **Lynch Screen**: PEG &lt; 1.2; EPS Growth last 5 years &gt; 18%; ROE &gt; 13%; Debt/Equity &lt; 0.6; Market Cap Micro, Small, or Mid.\n\n- **Schloss Dividend Value Screen**: Dividend Yield &gt; 1.9%; Current Ratio &gt; 1.25; Price/Book &lt; 1; Debt/Equity &lt; 0.6; Net Profit Margin &gt; 0; Market Cap &gt; 5 Billion.\n\n- **Fisher Super Stock Screen**: Price/Sales &lt; 1; Net Profit Margin &gt; 6%; Sector Excludes Energy and Real Estate.\n\n- **Burry Value Screen**: ROE &gt; 18%; Price/Cash Flow &lt; 25; Current Ratio &gt; 2.75; ROIC 10%-27%; Debt/Equity &lt; 0.5; EPS Growth last 3 and 5 years &gt; 7%; Revenue Growth rate Last 5 years &gt; 4%; Percent held by institutions &lt; 90%.\n\n- **Fundsmith Quality Screen**: ROIC highest 25% of Industry; Price/Cash Flow lowest 25% of industry; Sectors exclude Consumer Durables, Energy, Financials, Industrials, Materials, Pharmaceuticals, Real Estate, Utilities. (Includes: Communication Services, Consumer Staples, Information Technology, Health Care Providers and Devices).\n\n*You can add a momentum element to any of these screens by including: Percentage below 52 week high &lt; 5%-10%.*\n\n### Due Diligence (DD) Checklist\n\nThis is my \"to-do before a buy\" checklist, to eliminate companies found from one of the above screens:\n\n1.\tEarnings: Past 5 years growth of revenue, earnings, cash flow.\n\n2.\tRatios: compare to nearest competitors. P/E, P/cash flow.\n\n3. \tCash Flow Yield &gt; Risk Free Rate + Risk Premium\n\n4.\tCharts: is P/E at a relative high, is there stable revenue growth to justify P/E's expectations?\n\n5.\tfrom Balance Sheet - EV/EBIT ratio, return on capital employed.\n\n6.\tJudge financial health relative to amount of leverage (current ratio, quick ratio).\n\n7.\tVisit company's investor relations website and read their most recent investor presentation.\n\n8.\tMost recent annual report 10K - Read description of business and risks.\n\n9.\tSearch for Customer and Employee Reviews online.\n \n10.\tLook for ongoing issues or controversies with the company in the news.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHope somebody finds this helpful.",

        "selftext": "A lot of new investors consistently use PE ratio as justification as to why a stock is undervalued so here's a write up about the problems with that.\n\n## Background\n\nThe price-to-earnings ratio is the most widely used multiple in the world. Pricing is much more common than valuing. In the DCF (Dscounted Cash Flow) model you have to make assumptions about growth, cash flows and risk, in pricing it requires fewer assumptions and its the simplest form of this approach.\u00a0\n\n## Comparing PE ratios across industries\n\nThe P/E Ratio is difficult to use when comparing companies across industries. This is because different industries are evolving and making money in different ways and can have different P/E ratios.\n\nIf we compute the P/E ratio for 15 other companies and the P/E ratio of your company is 10 and the ratio for this sector is 15, we say that stock is cheaper. We are assuming that the other companies are fairly priced in the industry and because of that your company is underpriced. We assume that all firms within a sector have similar growth rates, cash flow and risk, a strategy of picking the lowest P/E ratio stock in each sector will yield undervalued stocks. Cheap stocks are often cheap for a reason. Therefore, we are making implicit assumptions about the companies.\n\nThis is the most common approach of estimating the P/E ratio for a firm but there are problems with this approach. Firms in the same industry can have different risk, growth prospects and profit margins. So if the stock looks cheap, it deserves to be cheap.\n\n## Investment Strategies that compare PE to the expected growth rate\n\nAnalysts sometimes compare PE ratios to the expected growth rate to identify:\n\n* Firms with **PE ratios less than their expected growth rate** are viewed as undervalued;\n* Firms with **PE ratios more than their expected growth rate** are viewed as overvalued.\n\nAnother note to take is that bullish analysts like to use **forward numbers (1)** because it makes the P/E ratio multiple look lower. Bearish analysts always like to use **trailing numbers (2)** because it makes their stocks overpriced. In its more general form, the P/E ratio to growth is used as a measure of [relative value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/relative-value.asp).\n\n1. **Forward P/E** forecasts projected future earnings of a stock.\n2. **Trailing P/E** measures the [earnings per share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) of a stock for the previous 12 months.\n\n## Problems with comparing PE ratios to expected growth\n\nThe biggest problem with the P/E ratio is that it doesn\u2019t take growth into account but it is affected by the growth. So it doesn\u2019t tell you much about the company\u2019s ability to grow revenues and earnings in the future.\n\nThere\u2019s three variables that drives P/E ratio for a stable growth dividend paying company:\n\n* First, payout ratio the % of earnings pay out as dividends;\n* Second, cost of equity reflective of the risk of the stock;\n* Third, expected growth rate.\n\nYou have to put in control for differences in growths and earnings, cost of equity and payout ratios.\u00a0\n\n&gt;\"In its simple form, there is **no basis** for believing that a firm is undervalued just because it has a PE ratio less than expected growth. This relationship may be consistent with a fairly valued or even an overvalued firm, if **interest rates are high**, or if a firm is high risk.\"\n\nSome of the best performing stocks have had very high P/E ratios, such as Google or Amazon.\n\n## Comparing PE ratios across Emerging Markets\n\nBy looking at the diagram below, Russian stocks look incredibly cheap. What we are actually missing here is that we have to consider the different [ERPs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityriskpremium.asp) between the countries and **different controlling risk factors**. Riskier countries will have low P/E ratios but we have to bring real difference variables such as country risk, growth (high growth economies should have higher P/E ratios) and interest rates (high interest rate, low P/E ratio).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iet1olj97t671.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f254897f3c64d14a85cb25e66765063787aac254\n\n*Emerging Markets, March 2014 (pre-Ukraine)*\n\n*Source: Aswath Damodaran lectures &amp; videos*\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nP/E ratio should not be used to determine whether a stock is worth buying. However, there is no single metric that can predict whether a stock is a good or bad investment but relative valuation should be used in conjunction with other tools such as a [Discounted Cash Flow](https://tracktak.com/) which takes its key factors in terms of cash flows, growth and risk and research about the company\u2019s financial statements to get a good picture of a company\u2019s value and performance.\n\nIf you are interested in reading more about P/E ratios, check out Aswath Damodaran's blog posts here:\u00a0\n\n[*Cash, Debt and PE Ratios: Cash is an upper and debt is a downer!*](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2015/06/debt-cash-and-pe-why-cash-is-upper-and.html)\n\n[*The Value and Pricing of Cash: Why low interest rates &amp; large cash balances skew PE ratios*](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2015/05/valuing-pricing-cash.html)\n\nOr if you'd like more posts from me like this I usually post them to my sub first: r/tracktak and my blogs here [https://tracktak.com/blogs](https://tracktak.com/blogs).\n\nThanks",

The dotcom bubble dropped sp500 -40%, nasdaq -80%, 16trillion USD wealth went to 7 trillion. The fed lowered rates to 0.75%, boosted borrowing and home prices served as a healthy collateral, which can only go up right? US was highly in debt before the bust, but after\u2026 oh with low rates causing booms in home prices, more debt. In this 2004 books he says, if home prices would fall it would be taking down the banking system (1:6 leverage at that time so 18% default was needed to make the banks insolvent, we know later the leverage was 1:20 so 5% default was enough). What would cause home prices to fall? Policies to curb inflation, aaaand when did the fed start to raise rates? Yes, early 2007. No more cheap refinancing causing defaults (subprime etc), and booooom.\n\nAmazing book btw on oil, I would recommend it :) thought I would share my joy of finding this out, maybe Burry read this book also in 2004?",

The company was founded in 1968 and currently has its headquarters in Santa Clara, California. The company operates through six main segments:\n\n1. **Data Center Group** \u2014 33.75% of revenue \u2014 Developing workload-optimized platforms for computing, storage, and network functions. These include their cloud service providers, enterprise and government data centres, and communication service providers.\n2. **Internet of Things Group** \u2014 3.89% of revenue \u2014 Developing high-performance computing for retailers, manufacturers, healthcare, energy, auto, and government.\n3. **Mobileye \u2014** 1.25% of revenue \u2014 Driving assistance and automation with their Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) products.\n4. **Non-volatile Memory Solutions Group \u2014** 6.93% of revenue \u2014 Computer memory and storage products.

It gets 26% of revenue from China, 22.9% from Singapore, 21.3% from the United States, 14.9% from Taiwan, and 14.9% from other International markets.\n\n\\--\n\n**The Company**\n\nMarket Cap = $226.69B  \nTotal Debt = $35.88B  \nCash &amp; Equivalents = $22.40B  \nEnterprise Value = $238.66B  \nShares Outstanding = 4.038B  \nEV/Sales (LTM) = 3.1x\n\nSince Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce founded the company in 1968, Intel has grown to become the world\u2019s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer by revenue. The name comes from a contraction of \u201c*Int*egrated *El*ectronics\u201d. The company was the first to develop S/DRAM memory chips, and these represented most of its business in the early years.\n\nThrough the 1990s, the company invested heavily in microprocessor design and helped to drive the rapid growth of the personal computer industry. Regrettably, for punters late to the party in \u201899/\u201900, investors had already bid the stock price up exponentially in the tech bubble. These late punters paid the price during the ensuing collapse and period of price stagnation.\n\n[Investors bid up Intel\u2019s shares and then wiped them out through the tech bubble.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5699c62-f84c-4eb1-8df8-7568c261a101_2400x1164.png)\n\nAfter the tech bubble collapsed, growth in demand for microprocessors began to slow, and Intel\u2019s competitors (most notably AMD) began to etch away at their previously dominant market share. An attempt by then CEO Craig Barrett to diversify the company\u2019s business beyond semiconductors fell flat, and revenues stagnated for a few years.\n\n[Over the long term, Intel has continued to grow. The stock price is still below where it was during the height of the tech bubble, even though revenues and EBIT are almost double what they were then.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0b7fd4c-5bd0-4f8e-8b84-2a53219ab442_3600x1747.png)\n\nThen, in 2005, Paul Otellini, then CEO, re-focused the company on their core processor and chipset business and signed a deal with Apple to provide the processors for Macintosh computers - a big win for Intel. Over the following 15 years, successful iterative improvements of the company\u2019s technology and the continued rapid growth of Apple helped Intel grow.\n\nIntel is a mature company with a dominant position, long-term stable margins, and slow structural growth.\n\n[Long-term stable margins and slow structural growth](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab8f5259-a0d5-4018-84e3-a9a2add3c701_2400x1166.png).\n\n\\--\n\n**The Story**\n\n*This mature semiconductor business has lost the Apple contract. After a substantial short-term hit, they will continue growing slowly and steadily, while their leading position and manufacturing capabilities will help them defend margins.*\n\n**Growth:** Intel has had an average CAGR of 5.7% since the mid-2000s. This growth has been broadly in line with market growth over this time and shouldn\u2019t be a surprise given Intel\u2019s dominant position, size and success of Apple products.\n\nHowever, looking forward, given that Apple announced it is transitioning away from Intel processors to in-house ones, we think this will deliver an immediate hit to revenues. Analyst consensus is for an FY21 loss of revenue of 6.7%, and we believe this is about right.\n\nFurther, economists estimate that the global client computing market and cloud data centre markets will grow at 0.1% and 19.0% CAGR, respectively, over the medium term. Based on Intel\u2019s segment weightings, this suggests ongoing medium-term market growth of 5.8%. Given the loss of the Apple contract and the fact that Intel has fallen behind on manufacturing, we think that medium-term growth is likely to be closer to the company\u2019s fundamental growth rate of 2.45%.\n\n**Margins:** Intel has had an average R&amp;D adjusted operating margin of 28.68% over the last ten years. This margin is far above the industry (weighted by segment) average of 14.62% over that time. Over the TTM, the company\u2019s margin was 29.91%.\n\nIntel\u2019s leading position in the microprocessor has helped them scale up and defend margins. The enormous R&amp;D and capital investment required to extend manufacturing processes and capacity for new products act as a consistent call on capital. They have helped act as significant barriers to entry. Intel is now one of a handful of remaining semiconductor companies with the capacity to manufacture chips internally.\n\nGiven this position, we expect Intel to maintain its current average margins by either pushing higher costs through to customers or improving manufacturing processes.\n\n**Net Reinvestment:** We expect Intel to remain an extremely capital intensive business (generating $0.61 of revenue per dollar of invested capital), especially compared to the industry ($1.71 of revenue per dollar of invested capital). Moreover, we expect their extraordinary R&amp;D requirements, which have averaged $13.5B p.a. over the last five years, will not diminish.\n\n**FCF:** But, given how profitable the business is, we expect it to remain highly FCF generative.\n\n**Cost of Capital:** Intel is a semiconductor and electronics business (66.2%) and a cloud services business (33.8%) serving China (26%), Singapore (22.9%), the United States (21.3%), Taiwan (14.9%) and other international markets (14.9%).\n\nThe company has a 0.2x average operating leverage ratio and a 15.7% D/E ratio. Moody\u2019s has assigned Intel an A1 credit rating, which is the same as our long-term synthetic rating but lower than our short-term rating of Aaa. We\u2019ve gone with the former because we agree with Moody\u2019s reasoning:\n\n&gt;\u201cDespite Intel's strong credit metrics, the rating is constrained by the relatively high operating and technology risk associated with leading-edge semiconductor design and manufacturing, and the volatility inherent to the semiconductor sector.\u201d  \n\u2014 Moody\u2019s Investors Services, 21 Sep 2020\n\nMoreover, the A1 rating drives the low (1.08%) chance of distress.\n\n**Other Assets &amp; Minority Claims:** Intel has $17M worth (at book) of investments carried under the equity method, $6.8B of investments held at fair value, and no minority claims outstanding.\n\n**Debts &amp; Other Claims:** Finally, the company owes $35.6B NPV in debts and leases.\n\n\\--\n\n**The Valuation**\n\nThe company reports in USD.

Instead of pitting the measure of my success against \"the market\".  I'm not competing when I invest.  \n\nThinking this way will help me avoid some FOMO and FUD.  If that doesn't work for your mindset/goals that is okay, too.",

It seems to completely describe today\u2019s market conditions. 2020 was a record year for the quantity of IPOs, and 7 months in to 2021, we have seen almost 2x as many as 2020, at very hyper-inflated valuations.

        "selftext": "I have come across a lot of amazing books, articles, posts and videos over the years and this post is a compilation of the ideas and concepts I have integrated in my due diligence process.\n\n# What is the goal of Due Diligence?\n\nBefore we begin, we need to understand what we\u2019re trying to do by performing Due Diligence.\n\n**In my opinion, the main goals are:**\n\n1. To study and understand how a business works inside and out.\n2. To form our own ideas, thesis and opinions based of our findings.\n\nI know this sounds basic and obvious, but it\u2019s the framework behind any good due diligence. While we all have our own methods and preferences, we should all keep these goals in mind. It\u2019s very easy to follow the crowds these days, but investments shouldn\u2019t be done solely based on other people\u2019s recommendations.\n\nIf you don\u2019t take the time to study a business and understand how it works then you\u2019re not investing, you\u2019re gambling.\n\n**So, lets dig in.**\n\n# Is this company real?\n\nI know I know, it sounds like a waste of time, and it is in most cases thankfully, but you're better off looking into the basics before digging in any further. Scams are real and they do happen.\n\n* Check out the headquarters address on Google Maps\n* Visit the company website\n* Look the company up on government websites\n* Find for news articles mentioning the company\n* Scan for social media mentions\n* Check Glassdoor / LinkedIn for employee stats and reviews\n* Read about who the Key Executives are\n\n# Financial Analysis\n\nLook through the latest **income, balance sheet and cash flow statements.** Go through each line items and calculate YoY and QoQ growth. Do this going back as far as possible and try to spot patterns and ask yourself questions along the way. For example, if you see debt increased along with R&amp;D of X years, look for an explanation, did the business release a new product or service? Did they expand their team? Invested in PP&amp;E? These are just examples. Try to think past the numbers themselves. Try to find out why they are there and what they mean.\n\nCalculate your go-to financial ratios and metrics and compare the business you\u2019re looking at with its peers/competitors. This is referred to as comparative analysis and can be extremely useful in identifying value or lack thereof compared to the industry as a whole.\n\nLook through analyst estimates, investment bank ratings and equity research reports if you can get your hands on them.\n\nPerform a DCF valuation. This can be a little intimidating for new investors as DCF requires you to make a lot of assumptions about the company\u2019s future performance. When doing so, try to maintain a margin of safety, it\u2019s better for your assumptions to be a little wrong than completely wrong.\n\n# How does the company make money?\n\n\u00ad\u00adIt\u2019s crucial to understand how the company you\u2019re analyzing generates revenue. If you don\u2019t know or understand how a company makes money you either haven\u2019t conducted proper research or simply don\u2019t understand the business, and as Warren Buffet says, only invest in businesses you actually understand. There\u2019s no shame in being selective and sticking to sectors and industries that you understand.\n\n# Let\u2019s look at Apple, they generate revenues in different ways:\n\n* iPhone\n* Mac\n* iPad\n* Wearables, home and accessories Services\n\nAs an investor, I need to understand each of these product categories. I need to find out their margins, returns, competitors, moats, strengths, weaknesses and any other competitive advantages.\n\n**I ask myself:**\n\n* Which category generates the most revenue and has the best margins?\n* What will the company fund with the free cash flow generated by this category?\n* What competitive advantages are there with this product?\n* What are competitors working on?\n\nIt\u2019s key to understand the primary source of revenue inside and out, as its performance will drive the development of other product categories thanks to the free cash flow readily available to be invested. You need to find out if this primary source of revenue is healthy, competitive and if it faces any potential issues or pitfalls as its performance can heavily impact the future of this company.\n\nSomething I give a lot of importance to is the market sentiment and competitive advantages of a company\u2019s primary revenue streams.\n\n**In the case of Apple, the iPhone is its primary source of revenue.**\n\n**I ask myself:**\n\n* What does the market think of the iPhone?\n* How do customers feel about the iPhone?\n* How do competitors feel about the iPhone?\n* Are there any incoming innovations that threaten the iPhone?\n* Is the image and public perception of the iPhone positive?\n\n# What is the Management team like?\n\nIt\u2019s very important to get to know the decision makers behind a company. As investors we need to get creative and read everything we can to get an idea and feel for the management team.\n\n**First of all, I look at who the key executives are:**\n\n* What is their background?\n* What successes or failures have they experiences professionally?\n* What is their compensation package?\n* What do they bring to the table?\n* What decisions have they made?\n* What direction are they taking the company in?\n\nRead as much as you can, earnings call transcripts, SEC filings, press releases, interviews, articles, social media, industry reports, shareholder letters. There are some hidden gems across these materials that can help you get a feel for the management team and understand what they value most, what would benefit them personally and how honest/consistent they have been in the past.\n\n# Insider and Institutional Ownership:\n\nInsider ownership can be very telling. Find out which key executives own equity and look for any recent purchases or sales. No one knows a company better than its executive team, so any equity purchases or sales made by them could signal incoming news.\n\nThe same is valid for Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds. They have teams of analysts that hunt for potential investments. Keep an eye out for their purchases and sales.\n\n# Historical Price\n\nThis is a pretty straightforward part of my process. I look at a historical price chart of the company I\u2019m analyzing and I write down the dates of major price dips or increases.\n\nI then do some digging, looking for the catalyst of those price movements. I scan through those dates looking for news, company announcements, micro and macro developments, industry/sector breakthroughs, commodity prices, material supply/demand etc. I do this to try and identify what causes the biggest price movements in order to hopefully be able to see them coming in the future.\n\n# Custom Financial Modeling\n\nMaybe custom financial modeling isn't the right title for this part, but I couldn't come up with a better one. I create a \"Frankenstein\" table by combining historical data from the three financial statements as well as different financial ratios and metrics. I do this for as far back as I can go depending on the age of the business.\n\nI really value this part of my process as seeing everything together really helps me get a better understanding of the individual line items as well as make connections and spot patterns.\n\nThe less I have to jump around between websites, statements, spreadsheets etc. the better for me.\n\n# Watchlists\n\nI add the stocks I have performed proper due diligence on to watchlists in order to keep an eye on them through my personal go-to ratios and metrics.\n\nThis helps me spot any changes or movements which may lead to another round of due diligence depending on what I see. It also simply helps me remember each stock. It's easy to get lost or forget about a potential investment with all the new stocks that we discover.\n\n# Repetition\n\nThis is the most important part. Repetition. It\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll get better.\n\nThe more you do something, the easier it becomes. Your understanding of finance, economics, psychology and all things investing related will be refined through repetition. The more you study companies, analyze their financials, track their developments the more you\u2019ll begin to spot patterns and make connections.\n\nDue diligence and financial analysis are much like story telling but in reverse. You\u2019re putting together a story based on various bits and pieces, studying documents, financials and more to understand the beginning and middle in hopes of being able to see how the end will play out.",

        "selftext": " \n\nHello investors,\n\nPlease feel free to comment if you disagree with me or otherwise!\n\nI believe Tesla's growth rate doesn't justify its valuation, aka overvalued.\n\nBasically, the idea is that the market is a discounting mechanism.\n\nI am actually an avid Tesla fan (have Tesla) and the company is doing amazing things. I think Elon is a legendary figure for not only bringing an EV revolution but also successfully launching a space company.\n\nWith my emotions aside, I also think Tesla's valuation is certainly not reasonable.\n\nTesla's current $630B market cap doesn't mean its current sales and cash flows are valued at $630B. That valuation is discounting all expected future cash flows to be generated by Tesla in the future.\n\nThe market is saying, \"hey this guy will pay $630B for Tesla so that he can receive all the free cash flow from the company indefinitely\". Essentially, that $630B price tag is pricing in the expected cash flows.\n\nMature auto companies typically trade at around 8-15x FCF, but say Tesla's not an auto company but \"EV tech\" firm so it should trade at around 20-25x Market Cap/FCF when it matures.\n\n**That means if Tesla generated $28B FCF, it would be trading in line with its peers at 22.5x Market Cap/FCF multiple, the midpoint of the trading range ($630B/$28B = 22.5x).**\n\nNow the question is how long would it take for Tesla to generate $28B FCF?\n\nTesla generated $3.7B FCF in 2020.\n\n**If we assume an annual growth rate of 35% in FCF, we reach $28B by 2027.**\n\nIn other words, Tesla needs to increase its FCF by 35% annually for the next 7 years to reach $28B FCF. Then, Tesla will have produced $28B FCF in 2027 and assuming it's a mature company by then, it should trade at around 20-25x market cap/FCF multiple, yielding about $630B market cap.\n\nNotice how we backed out the expected future cash flows to justify Tesla's current valuation?\n\nNow, the market may be pricing in Tesla's growth potential so Tesla may very well be trading at 30-35x Market Cap/FCF multiple (which is a very rosy assumption because only companies that are small trade at that range, Tesla is a &gt;$600B company already).\n\nEven then, to justify $630B market cap, it needs to produce $19B of FCF ($630B / midpoint of 30-35x range, or 32.5x).\n\n**Tesla generated $3.7B FCF in 2020 so assuming an annual growth rate of 35% in FCF again, it takes up to 6 years to reach $19B of FCF.**\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is that Tesla's $630B valuation implies that in the base case, Tesla can increase its cash flow from $3.7B last year to about $30B at some point.\n\nThis means that if we buy a Tesla stock today and if the company gets to $30B FCF by 2027, its market value should remain at $630B through 2027 all else equal because that amount was already \"priced in\", aka expected. In other words, you bought a stock and the price has remained the same for the next 7 years, not desirable.\n\nIn order for Tesla stock to move higher, it needs to increase that cash flow expectation higher, perhaps $40B by 2027 or $50B by 2027.\n\nThat's why during earnings, stock price goes up and down not because of its current earnings beat but because of the higher expected cash flow.\n\nThe stock price was pricing in certain FCF in the future but based on the current earnings results, that cash flow is not likely to hold up anymore or the company may actually generate cash flow higher than what was previously expected.\n\nBeating the current expected earnings is not the important part but what's important is the what the current earnings tell us about its future earnings going forward.\n\nI personally don't think it's reasonable to buy a Tesla stock with an expectation that the company can consistently beat annual FCF growth of 35% through 2027.\n\nEven if it can, I don't think it'll beat it by much. So the stock price may very well double in 7-10 years but there are plenty of better options out there in the market with lower risks.\n\nThe way I look at Tesla is that it has 2x potential in the upside and -25% in the downside, in the next 10 years.\n\nI'd rather prefer to buy something with 7x potential in the upside and -35% in the downside, in the next 10 years.\n\nAgain, this is my opinion and please feel free to comment what your thoughts are. I could very well be wrong.\n\nAnd I also think saying pe is high isn\u2019t enough to claim it\u2019s overvalued. Amazon has had hundreds of pe at some point as well. For growth companies, bottom lines are always going to be negative or low so pe is not a good measure to value a company for growth companies.\n\nFor more, please visit r/Midasinvestors \n\nThanks for reading!",

        "selftext": "**Valuation:** Undervalued\n\n**An Investment Analysis Looking at Why You Should Consider Buying Target Stock:**\n\n\u00b7 According to the valuation techniques that I used throughout this analysis, I have reason to believe that Target is undervalued and could be a good stock to buy. I arrived at a final price target of $275/share, which implies an upside of 9.5%.\n\no Although this looks like a good investment on the surface, there are potential future risks and catalysts that can influence the price of their stock. These events are discussed at the end of this analysis.\n\n\u00b7 The effects of the pandemic were felt differently by different businesses over the course of the last year and a bit. While most companies suffered due to the pandemic, there were also some companies that benefitted massively from the pandemic.\n\no Retail stores are one example of an industry that profited massively off of the pandemic, as they were sometimes the only stores that were allowed to remain open.\n\n\u00b7 Target is one company that did particularly well during the pandemic, however, with the pandemic seemingly starting to come to its conclusion, how will Target fare in the post-pandemic US economy?\n\n**Company Overview:**\n\nTarget offers food, apparel, accessories, home d\u00e9cor, electronic, seasonal, beauty, and household products to their customers in the United States. Target sells their products in their 1,897 physical storefronts as well as their online (digital) store. Additionally, Target owns 51 brands that they carry in their stores nationwide.\n\n**Investment Information:** \n\n*Human Capital:*\n\nTarget strives to be an employer of choice so that they can both attract and retain talented workers. Target aims to do this through talent development, engagement, diversity, inclusion, safety, benefits, and compensation plans.\n\nTarget offers a work environment that fosters growth and career-development opportunities. This includes providing their employees with the experience and skills necessary to \u201cmove up the ladder\u201d. Furthermore, Target recognizes the importance of having a diverse and inclusive workforce, which is why they monitor their levels of diversity and report them in their Annual Workforce Diversity Report.\n\nAdditionally, Target has committed themselves to maintaining a safe working environment. They plan to maintain this safe environment through safety programs, which includes both occupation injury, and illness-prevention programs for their team members.\n\nLastly, Target offers their team members compensation and benefit packages to support them financially, mentally, and physically. Target has committed to a minimum hourly wage of $15/hour to their lowest-ranking members no matter their experience, gender, ethnicity, and offers many positions of advancement to their best workers. Furthermore, Target also has 401K matching programs (up to 5% of their annual wage), paid holiday, vacation, family leave etc., discounts, insurance, assistance programs, tuition reimbursement, incentive programs, equity awards, etc. \n\nBy offering all of these benefits, services, and opportunities to their team members, Target is likely to experience less employee turnover. This is important because low employee turnover rates can help Target to save money and time during the firing/hiring processes. Furthermore, these benefits, services, and opportunities are likely to increase employee morale and happiness, which can lead to their employees feeling more engaged/important which can make them more efficient, and even increase customer satisfaction. This is good for Target as a company as it will help them locate talent when they expand into new geographies, and it might even help increase revenues.\n\n*Source:*\n\n[How Employee Satisfaction Affects Organizational Performance - HR Daily Advisor (blr.com)](https://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/2017/06/16/employee-satisfaction-affects-organizational-performance/)\n\n*Loyalty Program:*\n\nTarget has their own loyalty program that offers their customers 5% discount on most purchases when they use any of the eligible [Target Red-Cards](https://www.target.com/c/redcard-program-rules/-/N-4tgj0?Nao=0). Target has plans to leverage their loyalty program members to increase their visit frequency.\n\nTarget is able to offer their 5% cash back on in-store purchases, and 1% cash-back on all purchases that are not made in-store through their partnership with TD Bank. Targets RedCard penetration rate has consistently fell by an annual average of 4.95% (or 1.15 percentage points).\n\nTarget offers these cards to collect data from their customers for future marketing and planning events/activities to personalize them for their shoppers and increase engagement.\n\nFurthermore, Target is able to make money through their RedCards by having a large credit spread. This is observed through Target\u2019s high (24.40% variable) APR (Annualized Percentage Return). In 2020, Target made $560M off of their receivables from their debit and credit transactions (through their interest on late payments), however their sales reductions through discounts offered by these cards totalled $1.1B. This is up 27% YoY which outpaces their decrease in revenue from their cards which is 14% YoY.\n\n*Competition:*\n\nIn order to undergo my comparable analyses (seen in the \u201cinvestment valuation\u201d section of this report), I needed to find 4 companies that I could use to compare to Target in order to achieve a valuation.\n\nThese companies have to be publicly listed, operate in a similar manner, be of similar market cap, operate in similar geographies, and have valid financial ratios and multiples. \n\nBy using the above criteria, I arrived with the following 4 companies that I used in my comparable:\n\n[**$COST - Costco Wholesale Corp**](https://utradea.com/stocks/COST)**:** Costco is a consumer defensive, discount store chain that operates worldwide, however their main operations take place in the USA. Like Target, Costco also carries many brands that they own themselves (among other brands) and sells a variety of products including food, apparel, electronics, appliances, health and beauty etc. Costco has 552 stores in the USA and is a direct competitor to Target.\n\n[**$WMT \u2013 Wal-Mart Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/WMT) Wal-Mart operates their supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, and discount stores in the US and internationally. Like Target, Wal-Mart is heavily involved in the USA, and offers food, grocery, beauty, health, appliances, home improvement etc. products to their customers. Like Target, Wal-Mart also has an online marketplace.\n\n[**$DG - Dollar General Corp:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/DG) Like Target, Dollar general is a discount store that only operates, and serves their customers in the USA. Furthermore, they both sell food, perishables, beauty products, personal care products etc. Dollar General has over 17,000 stores in the USA (which is significantly more that that of Target.\n\n[**$DLTR \u2013 Dollar Tree Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/DLTR) Like Target, Dollar Tree operates their discount variety stores across the USA. However, Dollar Tree offers most of their products for $1, which is one of their selling features. Dollar tree also has similar product offerings to that of Target; however, their selection is not as diverse, and their products are typically not of higher quality.\n\n*COVID-19 Impacts:*\n\nLike many other companies, Target was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in light of this pandemic Target invested $1B into programs to help their team members well-being, health, and safety, which included bonuses paid-leave, wellness resources etc. I believe that by Target taking this initiative amidst uncertain financial results in their future shows that they care for their workers, which reflects well on their brand, image, and potentially productivity and employee retention.\n\nFurthermore, Target acted quickly to ensure that they met the safety, social distancing, and cleanliness measures in place due to the pandemic.\n\nTarget experience sales decreases during the start of the pandemic, but this reduction in sales was not long lived and Target was able to bounce back relatively quickly. Furthermore, Target was tasked with navigating and fixing their supply chains, as the pandemic resulted in many supply chain shortages. Target was able to manage their supply chains during the pandemic and did not lose much revenue as a result of supply chain issues.\n\nOverall, Target was able to navigate their way through the pandemic without too much material effects on their business. This ability to navigate through the uncertainty helped Target to achieve greater sales figures than their pre-pandemic financial results.\n\n*Financial Information:*\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Target\u2019s sales increased by 20%, their total revenues increased by 20%, their operating income increased by 40%, their EBITDA increased by 24%, their EBIT increased by 39.8%, and they increased their net operating profit by 40%. Furthermore, in 2020 Target was able to open 30 new stores, while only needing to close 1 store, this means they netted 29 new stores, which increased their total stores by 1.5%.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Bad):** There is always some bad that comes along with the good, and in 2920 Target had some areas on their financials which were not favourable. Targets cost of sale increased by 21%, which is more than their increase in revenue. This contributes to a lower overall gross margin for Target. Furthermore, Target\u2019s interest expense increase by 105% which is a sizable increase. This was really the only bad that came from Target\u2019s financial performance, which is a fantastic sign for investors.\n\n\u00b7 **Share Repurchasing:** In 2020, Target repurchased 5,700,000 of their common shares. This repurchase increased the value of the existing shares on the market by approximately 1.13%. This is great to see as an investor, and Target has a track record of repurchasing shares which is even better.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Options and Awards:** In 2020, Target issued 2,400,000 shares through option exercising and employee stock awards. Target\u2019s stock awards come in the form of RSU\u2019s (Restricted Stock Units) and PRU\u2019s (Performance Restricted Units). In 2020, Target vested 1,427,000 common shares through their RSU\u2019s, these vested shares are no longer restricted and were added to their total shares outstanding. Furthermore, Target vested 827,000 PRU\u2019s which became un-restricted and were added to the shares outstanding. The remaining 146,000 shares were distributed to the market through the exercising of employee options.\n\n\u00b7 **Total Dilution:** In 2020, Targets total shares outstanding decreased signifying that each share represents a larger portion of the company than they di 1 year ago. I call this \u201cshare inflation\u201d, and Targets shares were inflated by 0.65%. This is fantastic to see as an investor, however Target has inflated their shares by a larger amount in the past (ie. 2.6% in 2019, and 4.4% In 2018). However, this decrease can be attributed to the temporary suspension of their share repurchasing program due to COVID-19.\n\n*Valuation Information:*\n\n*WACC:* \n\nI was able to calculate my own WACC through taking the average result from both my High and Low WACC estimates. By doing this I arrived at an average WACC of 6.91%, which I used in my model.\n\n*CAGR:*\n\nI was able to find Targets gross profit CAGR to be close to 7% over the past 4 years. However, as a result of Targets increased business due to COVID-19, I decided to take a more conservative estimate of 6%.\n\n*Operating Expense Increase Rate:*\n\nOver the past 4 years, Targets operating expenses have increase by an average of 6.7% annually. I used this historic increase to predict future results.\n\n*Interest Expense Increase Rate:*\n\nOver the past 4 years, Target\u2019s interest expense has grown at an average rate of 9.8% per year, which I used to forecast future results.\n\n*Depreciation and Amortization Increase Rate:*\n\nOver the past 4 years, Target\u2019s depreciation and amortization has grown steadily at an average annual rate of 0.67%.\n\n*Tax Rate:*\n\nI was able to find Target\u2019s effective tax rate for the year 2020 to be 21.2% through Targets [SEC 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0000027419-21-000010/#i5d6e11e9e8174675a063efd3d071738e_37).\n\n*Capital Expenditures Decrease Rate:*\n\nOver the past 4 years Target has reduced their capital expenditures by an average of 1.2% per year.\n\n*Risk Free Rate:*\n\nI found Target\u2019s risk free rate to be 2.25% from a website called \u201c[Finbox](https://finbox.com/NYSE:TGT/models/wacc)\u201d, which estimates certain rates (like \u201crisk-free) that are used in financial modelling.\n\n**Investment Valuation:**\n\n*DCF:*\n\nI used the information found above in the \u201cvaluation information\u201d section of this report in order to arrive at a fair value of $337.19/share for Target. This price implies that Target is undervalued, and has an implied upside of 34.28%.\n\nHowever, in my sensitivity analysis of my DCF model, the lowest and highest valuations that are within +/- 1% of the estimated WACC and Risk-Free Rate are $247-490. These valuations imply that the most conservative estimate for Target is $247 and implies a downside risk of 2%. While the most optimistic valuation implies a potential upside of 95%. Therefore, it is pretty safe to say that Target is undervalued and has some room to grow into.\n\n*Comparable Analyses:*\n\nIn order to get a rounded valuation via a comparable analysis, I decided to compare 3 of Targets financial ratio and multiples to that of their competitors (listed above in the \u201ccompetition\u201d section of this report). These comparable multiples and ratios are as follows:\n\n*EV/EBITDA:*\n\nBy comparing Target\u2019s EV/EBITDA multiple to that of their competitors, I found Target\u2019s fair value to be $257/share, which implies an upside of 2%. This comparable implies that Target is in fact undervalued and supports the original argument made by the DCF model.\n\n*EV/Revenue:* \n\nBy comparing Target\u2019s EV/Revenue multiple to their competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $215/share, which implies a downside of 15%. This is the only valuation that implies that Target is undervalued, so I decided to do one more comparable to get a final consensus.\n\n*P/E:*\n\nBy comparing Targets P/E ratio to that of their competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $314/share, which implies an upside of 25%. This confirms that Target is undervalued and is similar to the result as achieved in the DCF model.\n\n*Average Comparable:*\n\nIn order to get one all-encompassing valuation from my comparable analyses, I decided to take the average of the 3 results which I arrived at. By doing this I arrived at a final fair value of $262/share, which implies an upside of 4%.\n\n*Dividend Discount Model:*\n\nThe final valuation model that I used in order to value Target is a Dividend Discount Model. This model factors in the average growth rate of Targets dividend, their WACC, and this year\u2019s total amount paid in dividends. By doing this I arrived at a fair value of $226, which implies a downside risk of an investment into Target of 10%. This is the only valuation metric that argues that Target is overvalued.\n\n**Plan:**\n\nWhen formulating my investment plan, I decided to take the average result achieved through the 3 different valuation models/techniques used in my valuation. By doing this I arrived at one fair value of Target of $274.99/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 9.5%.\n\n**Risks:** \n\n\u00b7 **Post-Covid Sales Slowing:** In their [SEC 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0000027419-21-000010/#i5d6e11e9e8174675a063efd3d071738e_37), Target stated that they exhibited better sales figures as a result of the pandemic. This helped Target to outperform in 2020, however, what will happen once Covid-19 is no longer a factor? If Targets sales stagnate or even decrease after the pandemic, it would hurt their stock price.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** Although Target\u2019s financial performance in 2020 was good, there is still room for error in the future. Currently, it appears as though Target is moving in the right track and has the potential to continue to post good earnings. However, investors may start to expect this, and if Target starts to fall short on their earnings, then these investors may be quick to exit.\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\n\u00b7 **Share Repurchasing:** Overall, in 2020 Target purchased more shares than they offered to the markets. This in itself is a very good sign and will help increase value for shareholders over the long run. However, the best part of all of this has to be that Target was able to achieve this feat after their repurchasing program was temporarily suspended. Maybe we will see Target repurchase more shares this year to make up for the suspension, who knows? However, if they can keep up this share \u201cinflation\u201d than Target will continue to remain an attractive buy.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** Overall, in 2020 Target had a fantastic financial performance. If Target can continue to overcome adversities and continue to have good financial performances consistently, then more investors will be interested and buy shares which will help the share price.\n\n\u00b7 **Post-Covid Performance:** We know that Target\u2019s great financial performance this year can be attributed to the effects of COVID. We know this because Target stated it in their annual report, however if Target is able to maintain a similar financial performance after COVID-19 has concluded, they will prove to investors that they did not just \u201cget lucky\u201d with COVID-19, and that they can continue to perform well.\n\nTo see the full analysis with my valuation models click [here](https://utradea.com/positions/Analysis_of_TGT__Target_Inc_Indicates_That_Now_Is_a_Good_Time_to_Buy_0?utm_source=R&amp;utm_medium=TGT)",

        "selftext": "UPDATE: \n\nThe weekly FBX shipping rates have been updated today: \n\nFBX01 west coast rate has doubled (in a week) to $13666 , \n\nthe global FBX container rate has gone up 32% $8848\n\nThe FBX03 East Coast rate has increased 52% to $16008 per container \n\nThese rates are insane - ZIM is literally printing money\n\nFreight Rates:  [https://fbx.freightos.com/](https://fbx.freightos.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - Shipping rates are going through the roof due to ship &amp; container supply constraints coupled with port congestion and huge demand as Covid unwinds - ZIM is ideally situated to take full advantage\n\n$ZIM - ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd founded in 1945 in Israel went  public with an IPO on the NYSE on January 28 2021, ZIMs IPO happened the same day as the Gamestop MOASS meaning it was  mainly ignored by the media and investors and ended up being priced at  $15.00 - the lowest end of its range\n\nEven after a run up  following the IPO, ZIM remains highly undervalued, shipping rates are  going through the roof due to increased demand coupled with lack of  global fleet supply, port delays etc, at its current earnings rate ZIM  is on course for a 2021 full year PE of 2 (TTM PE is currently under 4)  against sector peers PE range of 8 to 15\n\nZIM is a top ten global  container shipping carrier with a fleet of 101 ships in operation with a  total capacity of around 429,000 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit  container size) with another 10 x 7,000 TEU ships(LNG powered) on order.\n\nUnlike many of its competitors ZIM charters 98% of its fleet on  long term 3-5 year contracts reducing its capex and debt requirements  and giving the company the flexibility to focus on the most profitable  trade lanes for instance ZIM has 10% market share of the more profitable  Asia to US East Coast trade global trade market source:Port Import  Export Reporting Service (PIERS)\n\nZIM has vessel &amp; route  cooperation arrangements with other major shipping companies Maersk  &amp; MSC which ensures that ZIM has more certainty in relation to  capacity and cost efficiencies and access to charter vessels at  competitive rates\n\nOn 21 June 2021 ZIM extended its partnership  agreement with ALIBABA that allows customers to book space on their  vessels through the Chinese e-commerce giant\n\nZIM Market share\n\nAtlantic 153,000 TEU US East Coast &amp; Gulf to Mediterranean 14% market share &amp; Med to US West Coast lane 6% market share\n\nPacific 328,000 TEU Far East to US East Coast 8% market share - Far East to Pacific Northwest lane 5% market share\n\nCross Suez 84,000 TEU India &amp; Far East to East Mediterranean &amp; Black Sea lane 10% market share\n\nIntra Asia 208,000 TEU - Far East to West &amp; South Africa lane 5% &amp; 4% market share respectively\n\nLatin America 45,000 TEU\n\n22%  of ZIMs capacity is on 12 month set price contracts with the remaining  78% on spot daily rates, ZIM has a large profitable gap between freight  and time-charter cost, with time-charter cost coming to approx 20-25% of  unit cost, the 12 month contracts give the company certainty of income  covering ZIMs operating costs while being short enough in duration to  allow ZIM to renegotiate, taking advantage as spot prices increase.The  remaining 78% of the fleet are able to take full advantage of the spot  daily rates which are currently exploding higher as the world comes out  of covid and retailers scramble to desperately refill inventory\n\nFreight Rates:  [https://fbx.freightos.com/](https://fbx.freightos.com/)\n\nWest  Coast FBX01 FBX Global Container Weekly FEU spot rates were around  $1500 at the start of 2020, they rose to around $3500 by the end of 2020  and are currently around $6700, nearly double the rate in Jan 2021 and  over 4 times the 2020 rate, with many routes commanding much higher  rates.\n\nEven though the west coast spot rate is quoted at $6600 &amp;  East Coast circa $10,500 per FEU- due to the lack of space, congestion  and high demand, in many cases shipping clients are paying a premium  well over these rates anywhere from $11,000 to $23,000 to ensure they  can secure loading equipment &amp; vessel space for essential supplies\n\nFBX01 Far East to US West Coast weekly spot rate $6600 per FEU\n\nFBX03 Far East to US East Coast weekly spot rate $10500 per FEU\n\nFBX13 Far East to Mediterranean spot rate $12000 per FEU\n\nAdditional  revenue: ZIM offers door to door transportation - in 2020 23% of ZIM  TEUs carried utilized additional elements of land transportation\n\nZIM  promotes customer loyalty - 75% of ZIMs top 20 customers in 2020 having a  relationship with the Company lasting longer than 10 years.\n\nIn  Q1 2021 ZIM earned more per share ($5.17) than the entirety of 2020  ($4.96) and peak season has only just started, traditionally running  from 1st June to 31st October, even at the Q1 shipping rate ZIM would be  on target for full year earnings of around $20 per share (a PE of less  than 2) but rates continue to move much higher\n\nWhat is behind the shipping rate upsurge and how do we know this will continue?\n\n1. During covid Retail inventory has fallen to a 28 year low, this means  shops are scrambling to restock creating intense demand for goods from  China, Asia etc as more and more of the world reopens this demand will  continue to compound for some time deep into 2022 and possibly 2023\n2. Shipping has been going through a tough time the last decade and as a  result the number of ships is at a low, The worldwide inactive container  fleet is now just 2.8% of the global fleet and primarily consists of  vessels waylaid by accidents, urgent maintenance, sanctions and waiting  periods before upcoming service. Anything that can be deployed is  already deployed, as it takes approx 3 years to build new vessels this  supply pressure will not be relieved for at least 18-24 months\n3. Additional pressure is being placed on shipping due to congestion at  ports, a vessel that is delayed by a week or more will miss its  scheduled rotation which results in a cancelled (blank) sailing. Covid  means there are a lower number of staff at each port trying to deal with  a larger than normal backlog with more and more vessels turning up  every day.\n\nDemand is outstripping supply by a huge factor, None  of the above 3 factors are going to abate any time soon and the  likelihood is that things will get worse before they get better meaning  elevated rates for all of this year and likely towards the end of 2022  and perhaps beyond\n\nA quick calculation for full year earnings:\n\nZIM  carried 818,000 TEUs during the first quarter of 2021. The average  freight rate per TEU was $1,925, compared to $1,091 for the first  quarter of 2020.\n\nZIMs current capacity is 429,205 TEU which should equate to a full year figure in the region of 3,400,000 TEU transported\n\nThis will equate to a turnover of $7bn(average shipping rate of $2000) up to $10bn(if average rate is $3000 per TEU)\n\nIn  Q1 1.74Bn revenue resulted in earnings of $5.17, full year should be somewhere in the region of $20 to $29\n\nsound like buying a dollar for 50 cents?\n\nZIM management have the share holders interests at heart - on 22 April the  company announced it was paying off $351.6 million of secured debt 2 years early, one of the reasons for this was that the terms of the debt  prevented the company from paying a dividend\n\nDuring Q1 earnings ZIM announced a 5% special dividend of $2.00 (ex dividend date of Aug 25, 2021)\n\nZIM also confirmed their intention to distribute 30%-50% of 2021 net income  to shareholders via special dividends (this should equate to approx $10  per share)\n\nThe company also are carrying forward a tax loss in 2018-2019 which will be in the region of $132m and improve 2021 earnings\n\nComps:\n\n||Revenue|Mkt Cap|Cash|P/S|P/E|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|ZIM|$4.35Bn|$4.25Bn|$1.25Bn|1|4|\n|Evergreen Marine Corp Taiwan Ltd|$7.45Bn|$39Bn|$1.8Bn|5|17|\n|Hapag-Lloyd|$15Bn|$40Bn|$1.9Bn|3|16|\n|Yang Ming Marine Transport|$6Bn|$22Bn|$1.4Bn|4|17|\n|COSCO SHIPPING Holdings|$28Bn|$51Bn|$9.5Bn|2|7|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Innovation:**\n\nZIM  are at the cutting edge of shipping innovation partnering with a number  of tech businesses to increase their edge over the competition\n\n21st  April ZIM Announces investment in tech startup Sodyo Ltd and the  Establishment of ZIMARK, A New Company Providing Innovative Scanning  Technology for the Logistics and Supply Chain Industries\n\n\"ZIMARK will provide its customers innovative scanning solutions using Sodyo's groundbreaking patented technology\"\n\n\"The  ZIMARK scanning technology, based on markers, image recognition and  advanced algorithms, is the most advanced in the market, enabling  accurate scans from virtually any distance allowing multiple markers  simultaneously.

        "selftext": "#### Summary\n\n*Amazon is the most feared disruptive platform in history. The company has benefited from the pandemic and will continue to reinvest aggressively to continue growing rapidly. They will expand and disrupt new markets and continue using their dominance and scale to drive lower costs and benefit from massive economies of scale. But, their size has put a target on their back, and meaningful antitrust regulation could be just around the corner.*\n\nMarket Price = $3,366  \nEstimated Value = $2,805  \nPrice/Value = 120%  \nMonte-Carlo Price Percentile = 59%  \nRating At Current Price\u00a0= HOLD\n\n\\--\n\n#### The Company\n\nAmazon is an American multinational technology company focused primarily on eCommerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. The company operates a marketplace for consumers, sellers, and content creators. It offers merchandise and content purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers.\n\nThe company has six business segments:\n\n1. **Online Stores** \u2014 *51% of Revenue* \u2014 Offer consumer products through online stores, including fulfilment and shipping.\n2. **Physical Stores** \u2014 *4% of Revenue* \u2014 Offer consumer products through physical stores.\n3. **Third-Party Seller Services** \u2014 *21% of Revenue* \u2014 Offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in Amazon stores and fulfil orders through Amazon. Receives a commission and fulfilment and shipping fees.\n4. **Subscription Services** \u2014 *7% of Revenue* \u2014 Includes fees from Amazon Prime memberships, access to content including digital video, audiobooks, music, e-books and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single obligation.\n5. **Amazon Web Servers** \u2014 *12% of Revenue* \u2014 Includes global sales of computing, storage, database, and other services. Certain services, including compute and database, are offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term.\n6. **Other** \u2014 *6% of Revenue* \u2014 Primarily advertising services.\n\nThe company has expanded into new business segments over time, but it remains, primarily, an online retailer.\n\n[Amazon is still, primarily, an online retailer.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa85629d1-3f66-4c83-9436-0e54112d8070_1692x806.png)\n\nDespite being a multinational company, Amazon still gets the majority of its revenues from the United States. In fact, \\~90% of its revenues come from just four countries: The US, Germany, The UK and Japan.\n\n[Despite being a multinational, Amazon still gets the vast majority of revenue from the US.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43c930fa-4e78-45fb-8aba-324212995b10_1692x806.png)\n\nAmazon is the world\u2019s largest online marketplace, artificial intelligence assistant provider, and cloud-computing platform by revenue. Moreover, it is the largest Internet company and the second-largest private-sector employer in the US.\n\nThe company is known for disrupting well-established industries by applying technological innovation at a massive scale. Amazon enables authors, musicians, filmmakers, app developers, and others to publish and sell content via its branded websites.\n\nAmazon also provides Kindle Direct Publishing, an online platform that allows independent authors and publishers to make their books available in the Kindle Store. In addition, the \u0441ompany offers co-branded credit card agreements and advertising services, serves developers and enterprises through Amazon Web Services, and manufactures and sells electronic devices.\n\nThe company owns over 40 subsidiaries, including Audible, Diapers.com, Goodreads, IMDb, Ring, Shopbop, Twitch, and Whole Foods Market. It distributes various downloadable and streaming content through its Prime Video, Music, Twitch, and Audible subsidiaries.\n\n\\--\n\n#### The Timeline\n\nJeff Bezos founded Amazon in his garage in Bellevue, Washington, in July 1994. He started the company as an online marketplace for books but gradually expanded into electronics, video games, software, furniture, food, toys, and jewellery.\n\n* 1994 \u2014 Jeff Bezos founds Amazon.\n* 1997 \u2014 IPO at $18/share. Launches second distribution centre.\n* 1998 \u2014 Acquires IMDb and expands into CDs and DVDs.\n* 1999 \u2014 Expands into toys and secures 1-click patent.\n* 2002 \u2014 Starts selling clothes.\n* 2003 \u2014 Launches AWS.\n* 2005 \u2014 Amazon Prime launched.\n* 2006 \u2014 AmazonFresh launched.\n* 2007 \u2014 Kindle launched.\n* 2008 \u2014 Acquires Audiobooks company which becomes Audible.\n* 2011 \u2014 Kindle Fire launched to Enter the tablet market.\n* 2014 \u2014 Launches smartphones and acquires Twitch ($970M).\n* 2015 \u2014 Amazon Echo becomes widely available.\n* 2017 \u2014 Whole Foods acquisition ($13.7B).\n* 2018 \u2014 Acquires Ring ($839M) and passes $1T market capitalisation.\n* 2021 \u2014 Acquires MGM ($8.45B).\n\nJeff Bezos, who has led the company since he founded it, stood down as CEO in February this year and announced that he would transition to Executive Chair of the Board. Andy Jassy, who is currently the CEO of AWS, is set to take over from Jeff.\n\nThe company has been heavily criticised for its practices, including surveillance overreach, demanding and competitive working conditions, potential tax avoidance and potentially anti-competitive behaviour. As Amazon has grown, it has become an enormous target for regulatory agencies and antitrust suits.\n\n&gt;*\u201cLast week saw the filing of two more such suits, claiming the Seattle-based e-commerce giant\u2019s policies drive up prices. Those cases bring the number of antitrust actions lodged against Amazon since last March to at least 16.\u201d*  \n\u2014 Katherine Anne Long, [Private antitrust suits stack up against Amazon, mirroring federal scrutiny](https://archive.is/CbDLp), The Seattle Times, 2-Aug-2021\n\n\\--\n\n#### The Financials\n\nAmazon is one of those businesses that feel like it\u2019s simultaneously been around forever but also just started up. That\u2019s probably because it is. It only took Jeff Bezos 24 years to take Amazon from garage start-up to trillion-dollar company. Mind-blowing! Especially when compared to Apple, which was founded in 1976 and beat Amazon to a trillion by a matter of weeks.\n\n[The Amazon sprint from IPO to $1T company.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37661c25-ed0c-4e7a-af5b-1756b80852f2_2400x1163.png)\n\nAfter a barely noticeable market capitalisation in 1996, Amazon took off during the dot-com boom. Still, as the bubble collapsed, the company lost \\~80% of its capitalisation in 2000 alone as capital markets dried up for tech companies.\n\nThis was not good news for the rapidly expanding but loss-making Amazon, which needed access to capital. After this near-death experience, Amazon spent *all* of the following two decades continuing to expand and grow.\n\n[Year after year, Amazon continues to grow.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3e50031-efa8-43e3-b39e-5a840b7b3bb9_2400x1167.png)\n\nThe company's growth was other-worldly in the early years, partly because it was a tiny start-up with less than a million dollars in revenues in 1995, partly because of Bezos\u2019s growth ambitions. Revenues reach $2.76 billion by 2020, and the TTM to Q2 2021 were over $443B.\n\n[Growth was stratospheric in the early years. But, impressively, it has stayed high ever since.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48605a31-8023-439a-b7a0-1de2bd9181a5_2400x1157.png)\n\nOne of the impressive things about Amazon is that it has maintained an incredibly high growth rate despite its increasing size. Typically, the larger a company gets, the harder it becomes to grow at a meaningful clip. Amazon has defied this with their willingness to reinvest virtually all operating profits, acquire new businesses, and expand into almost any line of business imaginable.\n\nAmazon has *never* registered a TTM period with revenues lower than the last. In fact, the slowest twelve-month period of growth for Amazon was 2001, when they grew at a *pathetic* 13%.\n\n[Amazon has never registered a period of negative growth.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98288136-d47b-4497-ba46-39b7c928c6b0_2400x1163.png)\n\nHowever, on the income front, the story has not been as positive. While enormous operating losses in the \u201890s are explained by the company being a young growth company, it became increasingly difficult to justify these losses into the early \u201800s. In fact, Amazon was still registering operating losses six years after its IPO.\n\nFurther, rather than operating margins improving over time as the economies-of-scale kick in, which is what you would expect in growth companies, Amazon's margins have not only stayed low but have periodically declined. This suggests that either the company is not reaping the benefits of scale or is operating with a very different agenda and sees maturity at a scale far beyond anything we could previously have imagined.\n\n\\--\n\n#### The Previous Valuation - October 2020\n\nWhen [I valued Amazon in October last year](https://valuabl.substack.com/p/valuation-amazoncom-inc), I told a story about an enormous online retailer investing everything in growth. I said that they would continue to grow rapidly but that their businesses would start to mature and see the benefits of the enormous scale.\n\nFurther, I suggested that this scale would help them keep costs low and earn above industry profit margins. I said that they could use these profits, along with their enormous data troves, to continuing acquiring other companies in a successful and value-adding way.\n\nHowever, I finished off by suggesting that Amazon could become a victim of its success and was likely to be the target of significant antitrust regulation and even a forced break-up.\n\nI valued the shares around $2,600-$2,700 and assigned a \u2018Reduce\u2019 rating based on my Monte-Carlo simulation and the stock price of $3,200. Since then, the stock price has held up, and it currently trades around $3,300.\n\n\\--\n\n#### The Story\n\n*Amazon is the most feared disruptive platform in history. The company has benefited from the pandemic and will continue to reinvest aggressively to continue growing rapidly. They will expand and disrupt new markets and continue using their dominance and scale to negotiate lower costs and benefit from massive economies of scale. But, their size has put a target on their back, and meaningful antitrust regulation could be just around the corner.*\n\n**Total Market** \u2014 Amazon is so massive and sprawling that it operates in six connected global markets that I have estimated are worth $26.8T in aggregate. I have listed them out [here](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c25d337-d61b-455b-94e5-5ad126929dcf_427x170.png).\n\nWe can see that economists expect the Digital Media, Cloud Web Servers and Digital Advertising markets to be the fastest-growing. In contrast, they expect the retail (both on and offline) and logistics markets to grow much more slowly.\n\nWhen I weigh the market growth forecasts by Amazon\u2019s segment weights, I get an expected Market CAGR for Amazon of 8.75%.\n\n**x Market Share** \u2014 Amazon is a behemoth with access to deep pools of capital. The company has proven its willingness to spend and lose enormous sums to enter new markets and disrupt incumbents. Further, they are becoming increasingly acquisitive in recent years, especially in industries that border their own. Whole Foods and MGM are examples.\n\nThey\u2019re currently *only* 1.8% of the aggregate global market, but this is more a reflection of how enormous these markets are, especially physical retail, than the company. However, if we ignore physical retail (\\~4% of the company\u2019s revenue), Amazon has a 5.7% market share in an $8.3T market that will grow at 9%. I think this is a more authentic reflection of the company\u2019s position. I believe that Amazon will continue to reinvest aggressively to expand into new markets and countries and take market share.\n\n**= Revenue** \u2014 I have modelled Amazon to grow at an 18% CAGR. This rate is at the lower end of their historical range but is higher than analyst consensus (17%). This growth rate implies that Amazon will achieve sales of $1.5T by 2030 and have almost 8% of their non-physical retail markets.\n\nThis assumption is not one I take lightly. Turning over that much in a single year is mind-boggling. It is \\~$48k per second. It is the entire 2020 GDP of countries like Russia, Brazil, Australia or Spain. Turnover of $1.5T in 2030 would make Amazon 1.25% of 2030 Global GDP compared to the 0.55% it is currently.\n\nBut, the Amazon platform is becoming so ubiquitous that it is the primary, and often only, sales channel for many other companies \u2014 one that many businesses and customers can\u2019t walk away from.\n\n**Less: Costs** \u2014 I believe that Amazon will continue to use its dominant position to drive down costs and eventually raise prices. Moreover, when the company begins to mature and stabilise, the incredible economies of scale will reduce fixed costs as a percentage of the cost base.\n\n**= Operating Income** \u2014 I have modelled for operating margins to continue growing from their current level (\\~9.5% on an R&amp;D adjusted basis) and reach 13.50% by 2026. This would be almost double the weighted average of the company's industries (6.9% margins) and would result in a yearly NOPAT of nearly $150B by 2030.\n\nThe company has a regulatory target on its back that I believe inhibits margins from expanding much further. Significant price rises or margins getting much bigger would be massive red flags for global regulatory bodies and would encourage them to step in more aggressively.\n\n**Less: Taxes** \u2014 I have modelled the company\u2019s tax rate to rise from its current effective rate of \\~12.4% to my estimate of its country-weighted rate of 26.82%. The company also has a $13.4 NOL tax shield.\n\n**Less: Reinvestment** \u2014 The company is going to have to continue reinvesting huge sums. It currently produces $1.93 of sales from every dollar of invested capital. I have modelled for this to continue, resulting in over $530B of additional net capital poured into the business over the next ten years.\n\n**= Free Cash Flows** \u2014 Based on the above, I have forecast that the company will remain FCF positive and won\u2019t need to raise any additional capital.\n\n**Adjust For: Time Value &amp; Risk** \u2014 Amazon is an online retail (51%), physical retail (4%), logistics (21%), entertainment (7%), cloud services (12%), and advertising (6%) business. It gets 69% of revenue from the US, 9% from Germany, 6% from the UK, 6% from Japan, and 11% from the rest of the world. The company has a 0.5x operating leverage ratio and a 7.1% D/E ratio.\n\nMoody\u2019s has assigned Amazon an A1/A+ rating and says:\n\n&gt;\u201cAmazon's ratings continue to recognize its powerful brand, which is synonymous with online retail throughout most of the world, as well as the strength and profitability of Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\"). AWS accounts for the majority of the company's operating income and free cash flow supporting Amazon's ability to make strategic investments in its retail operations. In addition to its leading competitive position in both online retail and web services, Amazon also has a solid ecosystem of entertainment content and a formidable third-party seller business.\u201d  \n\u2014 [Moody\u2019s Investor Services, 10 May 2021](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-upgrades-Amazon-to-A1--PR_445977)\n\nI have gone with their rating. Usually, I would give a 1.08% chance of distress to companies with this rating based on the historical data. But, for Amazon, I have bumped this to 3% to accommodate for the chance of severe antitrust regulation forcing a breakup of the business or significantly inhibiting growth/profitability.\n\n**Add: Non-Operating Assets** \u2014 $7.3B worth of investments carried at fair value.\n\n**Less: Debts &amp; Other Claims** \u2014 $121B in debts and leasehold commitments.\n\n\\--\n\n#### The Valuation\n\nThe company reports in USD and has its primary listing on the NASDAQ.

        "title": "Does the Buffett Indicator at 214% (all-time high) mean we are in a Bubble?",
        "selftext": "(You can watch an extended version in video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIHPTkF95Lg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIHPTkF95Lg))\n\nThe  Buffett Indicator recently hit 214%, an all-time high. In an article from 2001,  near the top of the dotcom bubble, Buffett said that if it'll reach 200% \"we are playing with fire\".\n\nI'll try to answer whether it still means that today, and does the indicator being so high definitely means we are in a bubble?\n\n\\---\n\n**What is the Buffett Indicator**\n\nProposed in 2001 by Buffett as \"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment\", it was shown as a reliable measure going back on the status of the market.\n\nIt's calculated by taking the total stock market capitalization, through the  Wilshire 5000 index, divided by the US GDP to represent the US economy.  The idea is to have a view of how high the stock market is compared to the real economy.\n\nStock market valuation (Wilshire 5000) / Economy (US GDP)  =  Buffett Indicator\n\n**Current market valuation**\n\nThe current indicator valuation is 214%.\n\n[https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content\\_image/data/dc/dc10cd5fdc5801e5fc774a0a9ded2f9b.png](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/dc/dc10cd5fdc5801e5fc774a0a9ded2f9b.png)\n\nThis valuation is an all times high valuation, much higher than we had in the dotcom bubble for example.\n\nBut it doesn't mean we are in a worse place than we had been in the dotcom -\n\n**Detrending**\n\nAs technology and methods of working evolve, productivity is higher. It takes less to create what we created a few years back.\n\nBecause of that, valuations are naturally higher. It takes less capital to generate more value - making the valuations of companies higher.\n\nTo adjust to that natural trend, there is a need to de-trend the graph to compare to previous periods. Here is the de-trended graph:\n\n[https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content\\_image/data/56/56502fc700e33ec41b0f4bd4d7e5960e.png](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/56/56502fc700e33ec41b0f4bd4d7e5960e.png)\n\nWith the de-trend, we see that we are not much higher, but basically the same as the top of the dotcom bubble.\n\nStill, not good news, but here comes the reasons why \"this time its different\" (Pun intended)\n\n**Issues with the Buffett Indicator**\n\n\\-It's no longer the single best indicator-\n\nBuffett Himself mentioned it in a Berkshire annual meeting.\n\nInstead, a combination of indicators is necessary.\n\nOne that I recommend is the recent article by Ray Dalio. As the biggest macro investor in the world, I imagine that his combination of 6  indicators acts better.\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-stock-market-bubble-ray-dalio/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-stock-market-bubble-ray-dalio/)\n\nAnd by his indicators, the answer isn't that straightforward as we might infer from the Buffett Indicator alone.\n\n\\- It's too focused on the stock market -\n\nThe Indicator measurement for the \"market\" is the value of the stock market alone.\n\nTraditionally, that worked very well, as other assets were a good option too - so an expensive stock market meant a bubble.\n\nBut in today's situation, there are no other assets.\n\nWith interest rate at 0.25%, Fed money printing, and massive bonds purchases plan - the bond market is virtually non-existent for investors.\n\nAdd to that inflation, and the bonds market and most alternative assets are in a real negative return situation.\n\nWhile in the dotcom bubble, we had 6% interest rate, and no inflation - so the alternative assets were lucrative enough. Yet, the stock market was as relatively expensive as it is now.\n\nAll that is to say that the stock market is very expensive - but for good reasons. In the dotcom bubble, it was as expensive - for no good reason.\n\nYour understanding and conclusions from that may vary - either way, I think it's interesting to examine, and it gives another perspective on today's markets.\n\nP.S If you prefer to watch a video with similar content of me discussing it, it's here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIHPTkF95Lg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIHPTkF95Lg)",

To make a long story short, I used to be heavily invested in high PE extremely expensive companies (to name a few sectors: EV\u2019s, Cannabis, AI, etc). I reduced these positions substantially over the past few months and started focusing more on understanding financials and mostly on dividend paying blue chip companies. Without this transition, I know I could not handle the volatility in these overblown plays.

        "selftext": "If you are a by-the-book value investor like me, you've probably seen that you can barely count with one hand the number of stocks that meet Graham's criteria for individual/defensive investors stocks selection. To some extent, his methods are even called outdated by some individuals who overvalue growth and a less asset-heavy valuation approach, which to be fair has worked just fine in the last 20-30 years. However, BABA could be a once in a decade opportunity for many of us.\n\nAssuming that you are not afraid of the plethora of concerns with Chinese regulation, and that you don't allocate an unsafe percentage of your portfolio to a single stock, please find below the plain and simple analysis of BABA as Graham would recommend.\n\nAs a refresher, this is the criteria we will be evaluating against:\n\n1. **Adequate Size of Enterprise**\n2. **Strong Financial Condition**\n   1. Current Ratio greater than 1 (Graham recommends 2 but this is for Industrials)\n   2. Long Term Debt less than Working Capital\n3. **Earnings Stability:** Some earnings of the common stock in each of the past 10 years.\n4. **Dividend Record:** Paid dividends for 20 years or more\n5. **Earnings Growth**: 7% average annual increase, or 100% growth in 10 years. Use first and last 3 years average.\n6. **Moderate Price to Earnings Ratio:** P/E &lt;15  using last 3 years average EPS\n7. **Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets:** P/B ratio &lt; 1.5 or P/E x P/B &lt; 22.5\n\nAt the time of this writing, these are the relevant financials for Alibaba:\n\n|Stock Price|$157.96|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Market Value ($Bi)**|$429.36|\n|**Total Assets ($Bi)**|$259.97|\n|**Current Assets ($Bi)**|$98.96|\n|**Total Liabilities ($Bi)**|$94.63|\n|**Current Liabilities ($Bi)**|$58.04|\n|**Working Capital ($Bi)**|$40.91|\n|**Long Term Debt ($Bi)**|$25.21|\n|**Shares Outstanding (Bi)**|2.71|\n|**Avg EPS (years 10-7 using Diluted)**|0.79|\n|**Avg EPS (years 1-3 using Diluted)**|7.41|\n|**Book Value per Share**|$60.96|\n|**P/E Ratio (3-year avg EPS)**|21.31|\n|**P/B Ratio**|2.59|\n\nWith the figures above let's go through criteria 1 through 7:\n\n1. **Adequate Size of Enterprise:** obviously yes with a market cap of **\\~$430B**\n2. **Strong Financial Condition:** Yes. Current Assets/Current Liabilities = **1.70** and Long Term Debt less than Working Capital **$25.21B &lt; $40.91B**\n3. **Earnings Stability:** Yes. Positive EPS for the last 10 years.\n4. **Dividend Record:** No dividend but it's ok, the company has only been public for 10 years and has not realized full growth according to many analysts.\n5. **Earnings Growth**: Yes. **836.46%.**\n6. **Moderate Price to Earnings Ratio:** No .P/E of 21.31 but still very attractive.\n7. **Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets:** This criteria is not met, however, BABA's P/B ratio Still much lower than industry average of 6.57 for Cyclical, 8.4 of Technology and 4.73 of S&amp;P500.\n\nI'm really curious to read your opinions. Obviously there is a lot of controversy surrounding this stock with a lot of big players either entering or exiting their positions. In my view this is a no brainer for anyone who can afford to allocate 2.5%-5% of their portfolio in a single stock.\n\n**EDIT:** Someone realized that my EPS calculation was wrong due to CNYUSD conversion missing in some EPS figures. I updated the table to reflect that, which bumps up the P/E to around **21**. Still not bad considering the sector indexes but definitely it is not a pass for rule 6. EPS growth was also underestimated, updated to **836.46%**",

        "title": "China's regulations, the new 5 year plan, and what they are realy trying to accomplish $BABA",
        "selftext": "The most glaring misperception I\u2019ve noticed, is that a few investors still think this crack-down is about siphoning money from / purposefully harming Western investors. First off, it\u2019s not about this at all. This is about the CCP fixing China\u2019s own internal problems, and capital as a whole (not just western investors) being collateral damage from this.\n\nFor example, many of these companies that were caught in the new regulations, are already dual- listed in the US and Hong Kong. And some even only have listings in Hong Kong or Mainland. For example, the education sector regulations news broke the night of July 22nd (US time). In the days after, the CSI 300, an index of the 300 largest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen dropped over 10%, and over 20% since its February peak.\nForeign investors make up less than 5% of the domestic Chinese market, so this impact hurt primarily domestic Chinese investors\n\nAdditionally, the Hong Kong market is also dominated by mainland investors, with mainland institutions estimated to comprise ~40% of Hong Kong volumes, while mainland retail investors make up another ~20%. These investors are shareholders of many of the Hong Kong listed technology, education, gaming, and property management companies, which also experienced drops of ~20 - 80%.\n\nThe difference in Chinese policies vs. many Western governments, is that China prioritizes the labor and tech components of this equation more so than capital. While labor is made up of the domestic population itself (and the goal of society is to improve the well-being of the population) and technology is used to amplify this output, capital is face-less (or at least belonging most to those who have benefitted from the country\u2019s rise and accumulated the capital in the process, and thus have a \u201cnational duty\u201d to help &amp; repay their fellow citizens / country who helped them achieve this success).\n\nIn the 1980\u2019s while China was opening up, Deng Xiaoping famously said \u201cLet others get rich first\u201d. The idea was to allow certain enterprising individuals to generate wealth first, and over time this new wealth would be used to help \u201cbackward\u201d areas of the country. The intention was not, to allow some to get rich, and then use this newfound wealth / power to then go squeeze even more profits out of those left behind (which is what the CCP sees many Chinese companies to be doing today).\n\nCapital is meant as a tool (i.e. fuel) to enhance &amp; accelerate society\u2019s goals, not as an end-goal itself. Versus many Western markets, where it seems that the betterment of shareholders (and putting more money into their pockets) is often the end goal itself. If the well-being of capital must be sacrificed to ensure a better long-term direction of society (higher birth rates, affordable housing, protection of consumer data, a more free-thinking / creative education for kids vs. today\u2019s heavy burden of rote-memorization) then in the Chinese government\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s a worthy trade-off.\n\nThis is especially true if the capital to be impaired is \u201cfueling\u201d the wrong societal goals in the first place \u2013 such as high educational costs which discourage births, high housing prices which discourage family formation, keeping delivery drivers\u2019 wages low so as to squeeze profits to line- shareholder\u2019s pockets, etc. In this case, the capital wasn\u2019t being productive anyways, so there\u2019s no loss if the government impairs it (and sends a message to discourage future investment in these fields).\n\nKnow The Plan\n\nAs such, it\u2019s crucial to understand what China\u2019s priorities are first and thus where capital can go to support these objectives, if you want to have higher odds of investing your capital in China safely. The easiest way to understand this, is by studying China\u2019s five year plan (this is a \u201cblueprint\u201d released by the government every five years, setting the goals for near-term government policies).\n\nIn the last five year plan relating to 2021 \u2013 2025 (meeting held in October 2020), the government discusses how it aims to become a moderately developed country by 2035 (i.e. $30,000 USD per capita). It hopes to achieve this via a focus on domestic consumption (and of domestic brands), and by continuing to close the urban vs. rural living standards gap. In terms of innovation, the tone also changes to a focus on the hard-sciences (biotechnology, semiconductors, quantum computing, space exploration, climate technology, etc), and increasing the funding provided to basic research R&amp;D.\n\nSo What\u2019s The Problem?\n\nOver the past thirteen years, China\u2019s GDP has slowed from ~14% y/y growth in 2007 to just over ~6% y/y today. So why is this a problem?\n\nWell when the overall pie is naturally growing rapidly, the country can \u201cdirect\u201d resources (labor, capital, government policy / support) to specific areas, so that the \u201cnewly formed slices of pie\u201d have a greater chance of forming within lagging areas (rural areas, lower-income workers, etc). You can create new prosperity for these areas, without having to take chunks from existing pieces (pieces that already belong to someone else).\n\nHowever as GDP growth slows, so too does this ability to create new opportunities for the underserved areas, without affecting the prosperity of existing participants.\nSlowing growth wouldn\u2019t be an issue if the problems were fixed during the high-growth periods \u2013 but in China\u2019s case, the problems have actually become worse. Income inequality has in fact widened, and the IMF indicates that China not only has one of the worst levels of income inequality among Emerging Markets countries, but also one of the highest rates of worsening over the past 30 years.\n\nSlowing growth wouldn\u2019t be an issue if the problems were fixed during the high-growth periods \u2013 but in China\u2019s case, the problems have actually become worse. Income inequality has in fact widened, and the IMF indicates that China not only has one of the worst levels of income inequality among Emerging Markets countries, but also one of the highest rates of worsening over the past 30 years.\n\nGenerally in countries that experience slow growth, as the pie stops growing, the only way to better your own family\u2019s circumstances and get a bigger piece for yourself, is to take a chunk from someone else\u2019s pocket.\nChina\u2019s issue is that the starting line / opportunity to do so isn\u2019t equal \u2013 those who have amassed a large piece during China\u2019s high-growth phase (either through self-determination, or as a benefit of government support), are more advantaged and now have more power (bigger piece = more resources / access / connections = more power to acquire more pieces from others). These stronger players are always looking to grow too, and because of their advantages, naturally resources accrue to the top (\u201crich get richer\u201d) rather than flowing the other way around. Hence, this leads to an even wider income gap, and requires an even stronger force (the CCP) to stop this dynamic.\n\nHistorically one of the great equalizers and best ways to get your family better financial footing, was through education. In China (and almost all Confucius-based cultures \u2013 such as Korea, Japan, and Vietnam), education is highly prized, and the resources of the entire extended family would be pooled to support the education of a single gifted child (with the idea that when they succeeded, the entire family would as well)\n\n\nThis cultural mindset dates back thousands of years, starting with China\u2019s Imperial Examination during the Sui Dynasty (581 AD). This grueling exam was technically open to all levels of society, and helped to promote an avenue of equality in society4.\n\n\u201cThe civil service examination system was an important vehicle of social mobility in imperial China. Even a youth from the poorest family could theoretically join the ranks of the educated elite by succeeding in the examination system. This assurance of success in the examinations dependent only on one\u2019s ability rather than one\u2019s social position helped circulate the key ideas of Confucianism... The hope of social mobility through success in this system was the motivation for going to school in the first place, whether one was the son of a scholar or a farmer... This curricular uniformity had an extremely powerful effect on Chinese society, and the major impetus for this uniformity was the meritocracy promoted by the civil service examination system.\u201d\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because this system is very similar to the Gaokao college entrance exam used today. This exam lasts for 9 hours over several days, and this single test largely determines the rank / pedigree of the college the student is accepted into. While there are certainly valid criticisms of the test (imagine your future being based entirely on an amped up version of the SAT test available only 1x a year), it\u2019s also regarded as the fairest way of screening talent in a population of 1.4 billion people. Regardless if you\u2019re from a rural or urban family, a wealthy or poor family, the test results you get are still largely determined by your own ability (and not how much your family donates to a certain school)\n\nSo given the cultural impact of the Imperial Examination, which lives on today in the form of the Gaokao, and culture emphasis on education in general, where do you think families are going to spend their resources as they grow wealthier? Especially as due to the decades long one-child policy (now abolished), all their resources are focused on a single kid?\nWell on average, Chinese parents spend ~$18,000 USD per year on after-school tutoring. Considering China\u2019s average GDP per capita is only ~$10,000 USD, it obvious that the bulk of a family\u2019s resources are going towards their kid\u2019s education, with additional support from the extended family and savings.\nThe financial pressure on families, and mental pressure on students is intense. Starting in elementary school, 60% of students are already being tutored outside the public classroom (and steadily rising in % for older students), spending several additional hours a day ultimately prepping for the Gaokao. As an example of this pressure, in 2012, images of Chinese students using IV drips to aid them in studying went viral\n\nBut if your kid\u2019s classmates are all using expensive after-school tutoring services, what option do you have as a family? At the end of the day, it\u2019s a ranked test and the better your kid\u2019s classmates perform the worse your own child ranks, so you have to play the game too.\nNote: This isn\u2019t only a China problem, but rather is prevalent across East Asia. Ten years ago, South Korea similarly cracked down on its own after-school tutoring system (i.e. \u201ccram schools\u201d), where over ~70% of all students are enrolled. The private tutoring sector alone was equivalent to ~50% of the total public education budget, and the extreme mental stress students faced was often blamed for the high suicide rates and low birth rates.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that China has taken some of the lessons from South Korea, in enacting its own policies.\nThis dynamic has led to tremendous pricing power among the after-school education companies, which in turn led to these profits accruing to shareholders (EDU &amp; TAL being the most notable). In the CCP\u2019s eyes, the majority of Chinese families are subsidizing and suffering immense pressure, just for these resources to ultimately line the pockets of the few (already wealthy) shareholders. The government sees this as a form of rent-seeking, without adding value to society (it\u2019s a zero-sum game).\nIt\u2019s also because of this immense financial pressure, that China\u2019s population is declining. It\u2019s an issue for the country, since a smaller working population needs to support a bigger retiree population (who historically, have relied upon offspring as a retirement policy, and elders often live with their adult children).\nThis despite the one-child policy being modified to a two-child policy in 2015, raising the limit to three-children on May 31, 2021, and being completely abolished just a few weeks ago on July 20, 2021\n\nCombined with this, China\u2019s housing prices have also risen astronomically over the decades. There are several reasons for this, including rising prosperity + capital controls &amp; distrust of local stock markets, meaning that excess savings are invested into real estate. Whatever the case, the fact is that home prices have risen ~8% y/y over the last 20 years, and even more in Tier 1 cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen). The rise in home prices have also outpaced the rise in incomes \u2013 thus making home-ownership (a cultural prerequisite for marriage in China) ever- harder6.\nHousing prices are also intertwined with education, since where you live determines where your kids go to school (much like public schools &amp; property taxes, in the United States). Families in Tier 1 cities are buying up 800sqft shanty apartments for over $1 million + additional renovation costs, just to ensure their (unborn) child will be able to go to a good public school\n\nHigh child raising costs, high property costs, and long working hours (9am-9pm, 6 days a week, i.e. \u201c996\u201d) in many tech companies, are creating a unsustainable life for the middle class. These factors are all why marriage and birth rates continue to fall.\nSo what\u2019s the cultural reaction to this high-pressure, rat-race lifestyle among the younger generations? To give up and \u201clie-flat\u201d (\u201c\u8eba\u5e73\u201d)... The younger generations no longer have the optimistic hope in a better future, and a belief in upward mobility that their parents did during China\u2019s previous decades of meteoric growth7.\n\nMany Chinese youth are choosing to leave this rat-race, forgo marriage / children, have lower ambitions, move out of expensive Tier 1 cities back to their hometowns or countryside, and prioritize their own time / freedom over material possessions.\nOf course, this new trend also worries the CCP, as it creates a negative virtuous cycle, which affects the productivity and future trajectory of society as a whole (especially as China\u2019sgovernment has global leadership ambitions). In fact, the trend is so concerning that the phrase \u201clie-flat\u201d itself is censored by China\u2019s internet regulators.\n\nSo these are just some of the issues that China\u2019s government are trying to tackle. And viewed through this lens, it\u2019s easy to see that these recent actions are about fixing China\u2019s internal problems, rather than purposefully trying to harm foreign investors (they\u2019re the collateral damage). The country is trying to steer capital towards the fueling the right areas, where it views it\u2019s most needed for advancement and betterment of the country.\n\nChina is a state capitalist system, which by definition, capital is meant as only a tool to serve the interests of the majority of society. Especially with President Xi\u2019s historic 3rd term re-election coming up in 2023 (China\u2019s two-term presidential limits were abolished in 2018), the government is especially cognizant of trying to enact these fixes in a timely manner (which have been generally well-received by China\u2019s broader population in recent weeks).\n\nIf you plan on investing in any foreign countries, you first need to understand the history, culture and context of its people first. This is especially important in China, where the state has greater control over the economy, and the health of the capital markets will always play a subservient role to the greater needs of society at large. Hopefully by providing this background, other investors will at least understand the \u201crules of the road\u201d better while searching for investments in China.\n\nCredit goes to Hayden Capital, they are about 65% invested in Asia, and the post i quotes is from [there quaterly letter found here](http://www.haydencapital.com/wp-content/uploads/Hayden-Capital-Quarterly-Letter-2021-Q2.pdf?utm_source=Hayden+Capital&amp;utm_campaign=fefbd0ca3b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_02_12_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_aae4c81ce6-fefbd0ca3b-371858787)\n\n[r/baba](www.reddit.com/r/baba)",

        "title": "A spreadsheet that will automatically make you think like a business owner and long-term investor",
        "selftext": "## TLDR;\n\n## I made a spreadsheet that helps you invest like Warren Buffett \u2014 in great companies and for a long time\n\n# What does this spreadsheet do?\n\nThis spreadsheet puts you in the position of a\u00a0business owner, who collects the [earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p62wp3/the_biggest_misconception_about_investing/) of their companies on a regular basis. When you own a share you own a part of the business and therefore receive a part of its profits. It does so by automatically tracking and accumulating your\u00a0Owner\u2019s earnings\u00a0your shares. All you got to do is input your transactions \u2014 ticker symbol, date purchased, number of shares purchased, and share price.\n\nBy removing total portfolio value or day-to-day share price, which is not only irrelevant to long-term investing (mostly), but also suboptimal insofar as it can evoke volatile emotions and trigger poor decisions, as all brokerages do, this spreadsheet helps you make calmer decisions and stay invested.\n\n*For those of you unfamiliar with* [*Owner's earnings*](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/peo0rp/owners_earnings_how_to_value_a_companys_moat_and/)*, it represents how much cash falls into the business owner\u2019s pockets. Basically it is the amount of cash you\u2019re left with after you spend on whatever you need to to maintain, but not grow, the business and is a more realistic and accurate portrayal of a company's intrinsic value than EPS, Operating Cash or FCF. Here's* [Amazon's](https://m.imgur.com/a/Cis6Hdl) *side-by-side to prove it.*\n\n# How will it make you a better long-term investor?\n\nThis spreadsheet and the formula behind it have been meticulously designed to make you a better long-term investor. The formula is as follows:\n\n`Your earnings = Owner's earnings per share * number of shares you own * days held/period`\n\nTo maximize your earnings, you must maximize each of its components. In doing so, you will have achieved the holy grail of long-term value investing:\n\n**1. Invest in great companies with wide moats**\n\nTo maximize owner\u2019s earnings you must invest in [great companies with wide moats](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/p8r2lk/how_i_find_investments_that_outearn_outlive_and/) that can and will grow their earnings at a high rate for many years into the future. You don't want a company whose earnings stay the same year after year, you want a company that can grow as fast as possible for as long as possible.\n\n**2. Buy stocks at a discount instead of panicking when it falls**\n\nTo maximize the number of shares you own you must hunt for value and bargains. You have a limited amount of money to invest so you naturally want to buy as many shares (or earnings) as you can with that money. If two similar companies make $10 a year, one of them selling for $50 a share and the other $25 a share, you're going to go for the one selling for $25 (assuming equal growth rates) because you can buy $20 worth of earnings for the same amount of money. In other words, you want to grow your earnings as efficiently as possible.\n\n**3. Hold on to companies for the long run and compound your money**\n\nTo maximize days held you must hold onto your shares for as long as possible. The logic behind this is simple: Each day you hold on to a stock, the more money you make. If you hold a stock for a year, you make 100% of its owner\u2019s earnings for that year for every share you owned. If you own it for 6 months you get 50% of its earnings. The longer you hold onto a stock, the more earnings you accumulate, and the more your money compounds.\n\nBottom line\n\nThis spreadsheet is an improved, more automatic, and intuitive adaption from a solution I've been using myself and it's helped me become a more calm, collected, rational investor. Without it I would not have had as much fun finding great companies with strong earnings potential, nor would I have held onto them for as long as I have. In other words, it has made me a much more successful long-term investor and I hope it can do the same for you.\n\nHere's a copy of the spreadsheet:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dkoTDNG\\_JWeYP\\_GJNW8f\\_MVXfDbSWyZPlfTRo28OUM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dkoTDNG_JWeYP-_GJNW8f_MVXfDbSWyZPlfTRo28OUM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nHere is a video tutorial:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IuXwj8p6vi9XiaYWaOdDdLw3Urg34j6S/view?usp=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IuXwj8p6vi9XiaYWaOdDdLw3Urg34j6S/view?usp=drivesdk)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\*\\*Future updates:\\*\\*I will continuously update this spreadsheet to make it better, introduce greater functionality, and make it even more enjoyable to use (I am working on a version 2 as I write this).\n\nI put in a lot of effort in this sheet and it would really mean a lot to me if you could spare an extra 1 minute to share your feedback too \u2764\ufe0f\n\n*Looking forward to your feedback, comments, criticisms to make this even better* \ud83d\ude42\n\n\\*Disclaimer: I've gotten approval from the mods to post this",

I am new to the investing game, I don't have much money to invest in but I am just trying to learn on the side.\n\nIt always seems that a lot of these people are only concerned with financials and NOTHING ELSE. Today, a fellow redditor asked for recommendations on value investing channels similar to a specific channel they have been watching and having watched one of the videos, I am incredibly disappointed. This particular channel (might be very successful in what they do) happened to have analysed the financial numbers, came up with some rigid metrics of their own liking and kept on making their own blanket assumptions about why they fared better or worse in a particular year or quarter. I mean you would find the answers to it if you went on to read CEO interviews, earnings call, 10-K statements, news articles etc?\n\nI find arbitrary guidelines to investing such as low P/E, low debt to equity or 1.0 current ratio, a bit meaningless without context. It seems no one is interested in talking about how the company is doing, what do they make, what's their 5 year strategy, how good are they at generating sales etc. No narratives or story telling when it comes to valuation.\n\nI get that financial fundamentals underpin the whole philosophy of value investing. However, there seems to be a complete absence of abstract thinking behind those numbers.",

As readers head into the heart of fall, the FT reminds readers about the impending gloom. The Dow has been mired in a range between 65 and 75 since the spring. Any perkiness in the summer was quickly sold off. Investors should brace themselves for some negative movements, but not get too defensive because the current bear market seems to have plateaued.\n* Bankers criss-crossed the nation a few weeks ago and are eager to share their findings. East Coast blues were met with West Coast bliss. One banker didn\u2019t realize how nice the weather is in Los Angeles. He thinks that part of the issue with ongoing market weakness has more to do with psychology than anything else. He encourages readers to get some fresh air.\n* France calls out Berlin for monetary fraud. The French government illustrates the complete suicide of the German mark, which has gone from record low to record low this year. The monetary games need to stop, France warns. The appraisement of the mark is no longer governed by the valuation of Germany\u2019s creditworthiness or her resources, but by the question of her honesty in the execution of the Treaty of Versailles.\n* Rumors of Royal Dutch Shell exiting Mexico send shockwaves through the press. Some sources claim that Royal Dutch has sold down its Mexican subsidiary, but brokerages across London have not seen any evidence of this. Shares of Mexican oil companies get slammed. Is Royal Dutch planting these claims to get something from the Mexican government? One former Standard Oil executive turned private investor thinks so. If not, he\u2019d happily sink his entire life savings into Mexican oil fields.\n* The prominent German industrialist Hugo Stinnes suggests a fringe dictatorship might seize power because the poorly drawn up armistice extracts too great a toll on the Teutonic nation. He reckons that one of the infant right wing parties could take power some day. Whatever the case, trouble is brewing.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Roaring20sTate](https://twitter.com/Roaring20sTate)\n\nMore @ [https://roaring20s.substack.com/p/october-17-1921](https://roaring20s.substack.com/p/october-17-1921)",

Both cheaper money and improving business conditions are creating enthusiasm in the market. Stocks close flat for the week after rallying 2% on the rate cut, due in no small part to professional shorts engineering drives against various issues. The Dow consolidates around 75.\n* In Round the Markets, the FT writes that a prominent broker rushed into the London trading floor, beaming with pride. He jumped onto a stool and proclaimed news of the recent rate cut. Cheers were heard a mile away, and alerted more people of the news. Before markets closed, retail dividend favorites like Rolls-Royce and Royal Dutch Shell were bid up, all sporting dividends near 7%.\n* The guarantee committee of the Reparation Commission just returned from a visit to Berlin. This committee acknowledges that further payment in gold marks will be impossible, and believes Germany has failed to provide any proof of serious effort to meet future obligations. As a result, raw materials as payment-in-kind will be the path forward.\n   * **Historical Fact:** A comparable saga, albeit smaller, was the trio of Greek debt restructurings in the 2010s (2011, 2012, 2015). This culminated with the radical, anti-austerity political party Syriza coming to power. Critics derided Greece\u2019s final bailout as a new Treaty of Versailles. Fortunately, the bailout programs concluded peacefully in 2018.\n* The Federal Reserve Bank of New York further cuts rates to 4.5% from 5% on Thursday. The WSJ notes that there has been a strong feeling in the country that the policy of credit restriction was applied with unnecessary vigor in the early part of 1920. It applauds Benjamin Strong\u2019s decision to ease.\n* A letter to the editor comments on the recent rate cut. Unnaturally low interest rates of 1917-1919 gave way to frenetic speculation and economic activity the likes of which America had never seen. Nevertheless, the psychological factors that produced an atmosphere of optimism produced an atmosphere of pessimism for far too long. The Fed needs to learn how to counter balance these urges.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Roaring20sTate](https://twitter.com/Roaring20sTate)\n\n[https://roaring20s.substack.com/p/october-31-1921](https://roaring20s.substack.com/p/october-31-1921)",

On Wednesday, the Dow officially closes 20% off its low set in August. The FT stock editor illustrates the mood on the ground. Slowly but surely the markets are finding their footing.\n* Companies ranging from Ford Motor Company to Union Pacific Railroad report substantially improved business activity for the month of October. The current recession may have ended in the summer. Aggregate bond purchases were the largest since one year ago as Americans finally start investing again. Opinion articles, however, advise against common stock and its gambling attributes.\n   * **Historical Fact:** American and international investors will soon assume high GDP growth is a feature of the American economy, as God-given and laid down in the natural order as the seasons. At the end of 1921, however, it\u2019s not yet clear elements are present for business revival.\n* An interesting article about the state of the money supply in the United States hits the papers. When the gold standard was relaxed after World War I across the developed world, the US kept convertibility. An article notes that the money supply is 88% backed by gold rather than the required 40% due to strong inbound gold flows.

It will play an important role in the supercharged environment of the late 1920s.\n* This Armistice Day will be a somber one, with President Warren Harding dedicating the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery. Americans have been absorbed in the struggle of peace negotiations for almost as long as the Great War lasted.

        "title": "How to think about stock ownership",
        "selftext": "# How to Think About Stock Ownership.\n\nFirst I'd like to talk about what a stock is not. **A stock is not a random number generator** on your phone. It is not a squiggly line that bounces up and down. It's not a lottery ticket. A stock is a partial ownership in the underlying business. And in the long run, the stock's price will track the value of the underlying business. In the long run. But in the short run anything can happen. The two can diverge wildly. In fact, I can pretty much guarantee that if you own a particular stock for long enough, you will see it decline in price by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50%. And it may stay down for days, weeks, months, or years. If that isn't something that excites you, then you shouldn't own individual stocks.\n\nNotice how I said that **declines in price should excite you**. That may seem counter-intuitive. Isn't it a good thing when your stocks increase in price? No, not if you're a net buyer of them. If you're a net buyer of something, you should want the price to go down. If you're a net seller of something, you should want the price to go up. What you want is for your stocks to increase in value. This may seem like a pedantic distinction, but it's really at the core of value investing. Price is what you pay and value is what you get. In short, **you want declining price and increasing value**.\n\nSomeone once asked me why I thought long term. That's because I cannot predict stock prices over a short-period of time. They're essentially random. But what I can do, is find a handful of companies that I think will increase in value over the next 5 or 10 years. And if I don't pay too much for those companies, I should do very well. In the next few episodes, I will get into what I look for in businesses, both from a qualitative and quantitative standpoint, and how I think about valuation. But for today, I want to focus on stock ownership.\n\nIf I were to go to a cocktail party, and someone asked me what I did for a living, and I told them that I owned a laundry mat or a car wash, no one would think I was crazy. No one would think I was risky. They'd just assume I was a small business owner. Or if I were a dentist and I owned by own practice, no one would find that particularly risky. Or if I had some 9 to 5 job earning a steady paycheck, no one would think that was dangerous. But I think all of those things are more dangerous than stock ownership. A laundry mat is a shitty business. You have to hire people to work for you, and keep the machines in order, and hire lawyers and tax accountants, and it really just seems like a complete headache. Or if you have a 9 to 5, most of the net present value of your future cash flows are wrapped up in that job, and you could be laid off or injured or something of the sort. A computer program could replace you. To me, that seems dangerous. But I don't think owning a handful of superb businesses is dangerous.\n\n**I think owning Apple or Google is a lot less dangerous than owning a laundry mat, but if you told someone that you had over 50% of your portfolio in Apple they'd think you were crazy.** They would say that is risky. That's nonsense. If you look at the richest people in the world, most of them have most of their net worth in a handful of companies, and in many cases, a single company. Having a really great idea, and having the balls to bet on it, is how most people get rich. Most people don't get rich off their 20th best idea.\n\nAnd you don't need to have more than one or two good ideas a year to make a lot of money. If you can find one amazing company a year, you're doing fine. Figure if you have a portfolio of five to ten companies and your average holding period is five to ten years, then you just need one new company a year.\n\n**The problem a lot of people get into, is they sell out of their best ideas.** People will buy a company and then sell it because the price went up. They'll say you can't go broke making a profit. But unless you're taking that money out of the stock market, it has to go back somewhere. So what you'd end up doing is taking it out of a one stock and putting it in another. And maybe that next stock isn't as good. Or some people sell a company because the stock price has gone down. They use stop-losses, for example. Stop losses never made any sense to me, it would be like if you had a house for sale for let's say $1 million dollars. You tell your realtor, if someone offers you $950K, don't accept it. But if someone offers you $900K, accept it. It doesn't make any fucking sense. But people think that way. And some people will sell a stock because it's gone sideways for too long. They get bored and want to move into something else. So what you have is investors who will sell a stock if it goes up, sell if it goes down, or sell if it goes sideways.\n\nSo when should you sell a stock? Well the simple answer is when something better comes along. Taxes are no joke, so you should account for them if you're going to sell out of one stock to buy into another. I could probably do a whole episode on when to sell a stock, so I'll save that for later.\n\nOne last thing I want to say about stock ownership though, is that I treat it as if it were a small business. **I think of my small business as a conglomeration fo Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Take Two Interactive.** Now clearly, I don't have any executive power over those companies. I can't walk into an Amazon Bookstore and start demanding changes. I have no control over them. And that's fine, I don't want control over them. What I have control over is where I put my capital. That's my job as owner of my little business. I allocate capital. That's it. If I think management is doing a good job, I may invest more capital in their businesses and if I think they're doing a poor job, I'll pull out my capital. It would be like if I divested from a failing division.\n\n**And I think stocks provide you with a way to own an amazing small business.** If you had $100K, what kind of small business could you run? Perhaps the aforementioned laundry mat. Well with stocks, you can own a $100K microcosm of Apple. And you get all of the smartest people in the world working for you, and you're paying them essentially nothing if you stop to do the math. You get to leverage that brand name and have global recognition of your products and services. It's an incredible business, and you get to buy it with no contracts or legal fees. No real work is expected of you, other than just maintaining a working knowledge of the business. It's really a goldmine of an opportunity.\n\n**I think stocks are the easiest way for the average American to live the American dream.** Work hard, save, and invest. You won't get rich quick, but you will get well to do eventually.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n* [How to analyze a business qualitatively](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/rb4km3/how_to_analyze_a_business_qualitatively/)\n* [How to analyze a company quantitatively](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/rfmg0d/how_to_analyze_a_company_quantitatively/)\n* [How to value a business](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/rim0b2/how_to_value_a_business/)\n\nYou can listen to these and other topics on my podcast [How Not to Suck at the Stocks](https://soundcloud.com/user-650296856/064-investing-201?si=09c9f19af2af419b8b1480b5ecfb0a78&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing).",

Just two months prior, even Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon recommended high quality bonds. Analysts this week present their top views on markets, and all of them are negative. At issue are three unresolved issues: (1) curtailed purchasing power of agricultural regions, (2) high taxes, and (3) muted foreign trade. These analysts wrangle over the decidedly improving domestic business outlook, but can\u2019t make a case for stocks.  \n\n   * **Historical Fact:** Again and again, market forecasters, soothsayers, pundits, and Santa Claus get it wrong. In 1922, the Dow will surge 25%! Coming out of 2008, the narrative was lower returns for years. In 2015, private equity titan Leon Black famously said to sell everything \u201cnot nailed down.\u201d These conclusions were incorrect. Entering 2021, the consensus estimate for the Dow was 32,000 (4,200 on the S&amp;P 500), according to Refinitiv. Today, the Dow sits at 36,000 and the S&amp;P 500 sits at 4,700.\n   * **Historical Fact 2:** The major central banks (Japan, Europe, UK, US) have actively encouraged 100% equity portfolios under quantitative easing. Over the past decade, the S&amp;P 500 and FTSE All World have returned 16% and 12% per annum, respectively. The biggest risk is what becomes familiar becomes normal and we spiral into a speculative nightmare similar to 1927-1929. The ghosts of 2008, while fading, still linger.\n* The FT provides a recap of 1918 to present. Coming out of the World War, the media was gripped with fears of economic depression. An economic adjustment would be sharp and vicious, experts said. The opposite happened. Artificially low financing rates juiced Western economies. When speculation ran rampant in 1919, central bankers hiked rates to prevent overheating. This pushed the world into a severe contraction. Over the past year, according to the FT, European solidarity has evaporated and private banks have stopped lending. To get out of this slump, both issues will need to be resolved.\n* The WSJ takes a different path and reviews stock prices from the past several years. Its conclusion? Nearly all stock prices are below Armistice levels. Judging from the apathy at the end of 1921, the paper concludes prices are appealing. Of the 100 stocks featured, only consumer staples, such as Nabisco (today known as Mondelez), are trading higher from 1918 to 1921.\n* Opinion prevails that recent declines in German marks are due to artificial manipulation of exchanges by Germany in order to sway sentiment in favor of reduction or cancellation of reparation payments. Recent Reichsbank statements show incredible money printing: a doubling of money supply in 4 months. The mark/USD pair has slid from 150 marks per dollar to 330 marks per dollar over the past month.

        "selftext": "I work in the Canadian export industry and figured that you all may appreciate an update on what's happening with this global shipping crisis as it has a huge impact on many of the value companies that many of us look at. This is an update I am currently sending out to customers and is from a Canadian perspective but this effects all US shippers the same. Some of my US counterparts are having the exact same issues and are unable to ship through most major us ports, especially those in the northern states. \n\nThings have gotten much worse in Canada over the past 24 hours. Prior to this week, shipping through Vancouver was already basically impossible as no vessels were arriving to take cargo so all cargo was being diverted to Canada's other major port, Montreal. Now, because of the backlog of cargo and lack of containers in Montreal, our transloader in Montreal is refusing all inland deliveries effective immediately... both truck and rail, and they are the only facility that can transload from rail to containers at the port in Montreal. Additionally, the shipping lines essentially have no available containers in the port which means they are not sending any inland\u2026 So we cannot get containers anywhere in Canada\u2026. To add further pain to Canadian shippers, a record setting storm hit the west coast this past week which has destroyed multiple sections of the rail line that brings cargo to the port and the highways used as a secondary route to the port. So even if Vancouver was able to get vessels, for at least the next 2-4 weeks, there will be no way to ship through Vancouver as there is no possible way to get cargo to the port while repairs take place. \n\nThis means that as of yesterday, Canada has essentially been cut off from global containerized markets\u2026\n\nHow did this all start you may be asking? For a quick recap:\n\n1. China shuts down thx to covid \n\n2. US and European stimulus gives consumers never before seen levels of disposable income  \n\n3. Consumer demand = extreme purchasing levels of consumer products made in China\n\n4. Shipping lines divert all available ships to china to fulfill consumer product demand (which include toys, kayak, computers, car parts, ect). Consumer product sellers (walmart, amazon, Home depot, Ford, coke, ect) are willing to far out pay traditional markets for containers as they know consumers will pay whatever prices (case and point, vehicle prices skyrocket yet there is still a ton of demand)  \n\n5. Containers and vessels are no longer available for traditional shipped goods from North America or any market for that matter (grain, wood, ect) and lines increasing prices monthly while reducing service\n\nHope this is some useful info for ya'll! Feel free to ask any questions, happy to help.",

The worst of the market gyrations don\u2019t feel over, so traders are hesitant to embrace the upward trend. As markets look ahead to 1922, fear and trepidation loom large. Paltry forecasts from last week blanket the papers. \n   * **Historical Fact:** Today, the tendency for stocks to rally as they surmount negative news is known as \u201cclimbing a wall of worry.\u201d As we approach 1922, this is exactly what\u2019s happening. The late John Kenneth Galbraith once said, \u201cthe only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.\u201d\n* The feeling around the Revenue Act of 1921 is that nothing worthwhile has been accomplished. Some taxes have been eliminated or reduced, but not the most burdensome ones on businesses. The precise results from this Act will remain unknown for a few years, the article states, and Wall Street has yet to draw coherent and intelligent meanings from the bill. Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon warmly embraces the news of passage.\n   * **Historical Fact:** The Act of 1921 was the first of four pieces of legislation targeting personal income tax. While the media panned the 1921 one, Revenue Acts in 1924, 1926, and 1928 were more heroic. The top marginal income tax rate of the 1920s slid from 73% to 25% from 1920 to 1928, turbocharging consumer spending and swelling personal savings.\n* Onerous World War I-era income taxes pushed American and British investors into high quality bonds because accumulated interest was not taxable. Prominent financiers, like Otto Kahn, reiterated their recommendation for bond ownership many times in the press throughout 1920 and 1921. The FT features a piece on reasons why investors should stick with bonds.\n* The dithering over Germany\u2019s situation continues. This time, James Simpson, a VP for Marshall Field's (today known as Macy\u2019s), writes to the Journal regarding his trip to Europe. What he finds shocks him: economic and financial chaos. He concludes Germany has two paths, and it will be up to the United States to arrest either from happening. The better path forward, in his view, is to provide 2-3 years of breathing room coupled with debt reductions to the current untenable reality.\n\n\\[ [https://twitter.com/Roaring20sTate](https://twitter.com/Roaring20sTate) / [https://roaring20s.substack.com/p/november-21-1921](https://roaring20s.substack.com/p/november-21-1921) \\]",

        "selftext": "# How to Analyze a Business Qualitatively\n\nMy first article, [How to Think About Stock Ownership](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/qpkyf2/how_to_think_about_stock_ownership/), was a big hit, so here's the next in the series.\n\nThe first question I always ask myself is, **do I understand the business?** And if the answer\u2019s no, that\u2019s fine, just move onto the next company. And if you\u2019re being honest with yourself, then the answer is usually going to be no. Once a year or so, I like to export a list of every company with a market cap of over $5 billion or so, and then I sort them by industry and sector. Then I start chiseling away at the list. I remove airlines. I remove automobiles. I remove fashion. I remove pharmaceuticals. I remove all the stuff I dont understand and then take a look at what\u2019s left. That\u2019s my investment universe, or circle of competence as Buffett would say.\n\nAnd now keep in mind, I\u2019m not saying ignorance is bliss. You should always trying to be learning, but the important thing is to admit when you don\u2019t know enough about something to invest in it. Investing takes an odd combination of confidence and humility that way.\n\nThe next question I always ask myself is, **will the company be around in five or ten years?** And if the answer isn\u2019t an emphatic Yes! then maybe you should be investing elsewhere. That question forces me to think long term. What are the companies\u2019 long term prospects? Let everyone else try to predict what earnings are going to be this quarter or that. I have really have no interest in that game. And it\u2019s not because you can\u2019t make a lot of money being right about earnings calls, it\u2019s just I don\u2019t think I have any edge there. But I do think I have an edge in thinking about the future of society and how certain businesses may be able to fit into that future.\n\nWhich leads me to the last question, **does the firm have any competitive advantages?** Competitive advantages give me a frame work to analyze the competitive landscape of the business. If a firm is super profitable, then economics tells us that other firms are going to try and come in and take those profits. Competitive advantages are a way for companies to hold off those other firms for as long as possible. I break it down into four buckets.\n\nThe first one is **Low Cost Provider**. This is when the company can provide the product or service for less money than the competitors. So it can either afford to charge less or it can charge the same, but enjoy wider margins. Think of a company like Netflix. It spends a shit load of money on content, but that money is spread out over 220 million subscribers. So their cost to provide you with any given tv show is substantially less than Hulu, for example, on a per customer basis.\n\nThe next one is **High Switching Costs**. That\u2019s when customers are essentially locked into a product or service. Think of Excel. You can download Open Office for free and it works pretty well. But you have to learn new formulas and menus and if you send a spreadsheet in .ODS it may not open for your coworker or client who is using Excel. So even though there isn\u2019t a financial cost to switching, there are still costs.\n\nThen there are **Network Effects**. Amazon is a great example. Buyers go on Amazon because that\u2019s where the Sellers are and Sellers go on Amazon because that\u2019s where the Buyers are. And each additional seller makes the platform more valuable to each individual buyer, and certainly visa versa.\n\nThe final competitive advantage is **Intangible Assets**, which is admittedly a catch all. This one includes things like patents, regional monopolies, or brand. **Brand is often misunderstood**. Just because you recognize a brand name doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s valuable. The brand name has to influence sales, either by providing the business with sales volume or pricing power. A powerful brand is Disney. Every year they can charge more for a ticket to Disneyland and every year more people show up.\n\nNow let me talk about what is not a competitive advantage. Market share. **Market share is not a competitive advantage.** If it were, there would be no point to do any more analysis. We could just look up the company\u2019s market share, and go \u201cwell, that\u2019s never going to change.\u201d But that\u2019s not how it works. The study of competitive advantages is the study of how market shares can change over time. A firm that is lacking in competitive advantages will see its market share erode over time. And a firm that has strong competitive advantages may even see its market share increase. It depends on the specific business.\n\nAnother way to define it, is it\u2019s the Kevin O\u2019Leary argument. Have you ever seen Shark Tank on TV? It\u2019s a show about these entrepreneurs that go on television looking for funding. Mark Cuban is on it. Damien, the guy that made FUBU. Anyway, Kevin O\u2019Leary is this guy that always asks the question, **\u201cwhat\u2019s to stop another company from coming in and ripping you off?\u201d** And it\u2019s probably the single most important question that ever gets asked on that show. And it\u2019s a question I always ask whenever someone pitches a stock to me. \u201cWhat is to stop someone else from coming in and doing the same thing?\u201d\n\nThe next episode is going to be about quantitive analysis of the business, but there\u2019s one last point I want to raise. In Phillip Fisher\u2019s book, Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, he delineates 15 points that you could use to appraise a company. He concedes that a company may still be worth investment if it fails on a few points, but there is one point that he lists as an exception. He shares a story about a factory where the workers weren\u2019t being allowed enough time to wash their hands during their lunch break, so they were eating their lunches with hands covered in oil and grease. Fisher said that it didn\u2019t matter how well that company performed on the other 14 points, he wouldn\u2019t invest in a company based on that story alone. And that really has me bothered, because I\u2019m invested in Amazon. I think the point he\u2019s trying to make is, **a company\u2019s financial performance may be a mirage if it\u2019s based on exploiting workers.** Because eventually those workers will strike.\n\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say on that and on the overall topic of qualitative analysis, but that doesn\u2019t mean those are the only things to consider. Each company is different. That\u2019s why I always say to read through the 10Ks and the 10Qs and really pay attention to the footnotes. Read newspaper articles. Watch YouTube videos. Read books, talk to to customers, talk to employees. Really try to paint a picture. **Pretend you\u2019re an investigative journalist or a scientist.** Really think about the company\u2019s future before you make an investment.\n\nAlright, thank you for reading, have a great day.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n* [How to analyze a company quantitatively](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/rfmg0d/how_to_analyze_a_company_quantitatively/)\n* [How to value a business](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/rim0b2/how_to_value_a_business/)\n\nYou can listen to this and other topics on my podcast, [How Not to Suck at the Stocks](https://soundcloud.com/user-650296856/069-investing-202?si=5a9891f2d9774c0a9ac1d1c65be0b165&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing).",

        "selftext": "Be like ***Samuel L. Jackson***. I got to thinking about this earlier today while I was reading Future Shock (Toffler). What that book has to do with the 72 yr old actor I have no idea. He was unknown when it was written. Idea formulation is weird that way.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson is an American actor. Most of you are familiar with something he's done. He's been at it for about five decades. Samuel was John Shaft, in Shaft. He was tired of [those motherfuckin' snakes on that motherfuckin' plane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubLRB7tb78Q). He tells children to [Go the Fuck to Sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_the_Fuck_to_Sleep#Celebrity_readings), in a way that only he can make endearing. He was Jules in Pulp Fiction and [Nick Fury, mastermind behind the Avengers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZkGQkOAFoQ).\n\nOh yeah, he's also on the Jedi Council. He gets after it.\n\nWhat else does he do? Whatever he wants, I'd guess. Among the highest grossing actors of all time, [his films have grossed north of 27 billion dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_actors#All_roles). Sure, a large part of it is concentrated on some recent mega-hits like Avengers. Was that an accident, that he got that role? 50 years, 138 films, and 27 billion dollars of work, earning most of it very late in his career? Those are super investor numbers. I'd say it's *luck meeting preparation.* Sounds an awful lot like the career of He-who-shall-not-be-named.\n\nSo how does Samuel L. Jackson do it, and what's it got to do with investment? He's a bargain hunter.\n\nWhat's his rule for being in a film?\n\n* Is it artistic merit? The film has to feed my ego, speak to my soul? Doubt it. See Snakes on a plane.\n* Is it diversification? I can't play the same type twice, lest I be pigeon-holed? No. Definitely not.\n* It's money. Pay my fee, and I'll be in your film. That's my guess. Money.\n\nHe didn't do Snakes on a Plane because it was going to win an Oscar. He did it because they paid his fee, and it probably looked like fun. Bargain hunter.\n\nIt's a brilliant screening strategy. Pay my fee. *Put enough skin in the game and I'll loan you my reputation and skill set.* This is similar to an investing idea: \"Don't tell me what you think, show me what you own.\"\n\nThat's what we're doing as investors. **Pay my fee, and I'll borrow you money.** That's investment. The fee for common stocks is the expected rate of return. The active investor dictates his (or her) own fee. If we assess situations well, over the long-term we get paid well.\n\nIf anybody could have 10 wives and make it work, it'd be Samuel. He's been married to the same woman for 50 years. They have one (grown) kid. Another trait of a bargain hunter - not needing a long train of baggage (partners, houses, stuff) to be satisfied.\n\nDid you know he wasn't born famous? He didn't get famous til he was 40. Long after he watched Denzel Washington, Lawrence Fishbourne, and Morgan Freeman get their breaks. Just a few guys who've made a couple movies. Before fame, they were all in running in the same theater circles. Coincidence? Or putting yourself in the right place? Can you think of some famous investors who put in decades of work before they became widely known?\n\nHe didn't split his bets. In dating/love that's called monkey branching (aka two-timing). He worked as an actor. When he didn't have acting work he was on set doing something else. Anything else. Whatever paid. He wasn't in a restaurant waiting tables or tending bar while he waited for an acting role. He was in the studio. Where films get made. Where actors work. He was learning the craft. ***Putting himself in the right place everyday, preparing for opportunity.***\n\nWasn't that his life was perfect. He was a drug addict for a period of time, before he got his first big break (Pulp Fiction). It was that he kept showing up. Kept practicing. Didn't hedge. [Plan B](https://youtu.be/CrRQhY71QUk?t=330) is to pay attention to making sure Plan A doesn't fail.\n\nGolf is a good comparison. Golf has no hedging. No teammates, no blame game. You put the ball in the hole, or you take a bogie. You've got the proper club for the job. You've sussed out the weather, scouted the terrain. You've taken enough practice swings. Or you haven't, and you get a mediocre score.\n\nTo all the new people showing up to this sub lately, asking how bargain hunting works, here are some answers:\n\n1. Which books do I read? One per week. For the rest of your life. Knowledge compounds.\n2. Which strategy do I adapt? The one that fits your personality. Temperament matters.\n3. How do I improve? Show up. Every day. Active investment is a job.\n\nEvery time I'm going anywhere (car, walking, plane, whatever) I'm thinking about businesses. To the point of obsession.\n\nWhy is that Chick-fil-a so successful, yet the Burger King across the street is dying and the Subway next door is boarded up? They all serve chicken sandwiches. What's different? Skin in the game, superior service, consistency in food quality\n\nWhy is this Walmart on the outskirts of town regularly packed, and the Big Lots in the city center only ever has half a dozen cars? What's different? Selection, price, convenience\n\nWow look at the For Lease / For Sale sign on that building. \"Any reasonable offers considered.\" This is not a normal advertising sign. That sounds like my favorite phrase, \"***at any price***.\" I should write down that phone # and investigate.\n\nStephen King reads books while he's waiting in line. Samuel L. Jackson probably thinks about his next role. I think about businesses.\n\nHalf-assing it in this industry leaves you with far worse results than accepting the indexer's return.\n\nBe like Samuel, or be somewhere else.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n* More math won't save you. Arithmetic is sufficient. Thinking is your edge.\n* Discipline without passion won't save you. Be curious or be an indexer and accept average returns.\n* Nobody can tell you what you're competent to value. One person's semi-conductor heaven is another person's high fashion hell. Stay in your circle.\n* The too hard pile is something that should be taught in grade school, but never is.",

The process is simple:\n\n* Find a way to \u201cdisrupt\u201d an industry of\u00a0*real*\u00a0producers. (IE book publishers, taxi drivers, content creators, house hosts, etc.)\n* Create an attractive site/app and charge a fat fee as the broker.\n* Build a huge amount of media hype to attract colossal amounts of debt and private equity across several rounds of funding.\n* Rather than paying a dividend to shareholders, use their original investment and their annual profits to strengthen your team and strangle your competition. Make sure the story of your rapid expansion overshadows your mounting losses.\n* Once you\u2019ve destroyed the competition and have finally started to turn a meager profit, use the money to swallow up-and-coming competitors and coerce democracy to extract advantages that small companies can\u2019t get.\n\nIf this sounds like a giant, anti-meritocratic unethical fraud, it\u2019s because it is.\n\n**A new paradigm:**\n\nIn previous generations, such a dismal record of profit loss would make companies like these worthless, with investors avoiding them at all costs. In today\u2019s fairy tale/nightmare of destructive financialization \u2014 paired with huge amounts of hype and publicity \u2014 they are seen as a brilliant and important investments, with stock speculators assigning them an initial public market \u201cvalue\u201d in the billions.\n\n**The old business valuation paradigm**: a company\u2019s stock price was based on saleable tangible assets, plus net profits in the form of dividends, plus projected growth over a reasonable multiple.\n\n**The new business valuation paradigm**: a company\u2019s stock price is based on pure media hype and the hope of a future global monopoly.\n\nIt\u2019s vital to understand that companies aren\u2019t selling products and services anymore\u2026\u00a0*their real product is their stock price*.\n\n**It\u2019s all about \u201cstory-telling\u201d**\n\nSeth Godin says that all marketers are liars \u2014 and today\u2019s big tech CEOs are the ultimate marketers.\n\nThey\u2019re so good at storytelling and myth-making that they\u2019ve managed to convince a generation of young, mostly Robinhood-based gamblers to boost their stock prices to the moon.\n\nThe\u00a0[price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp)\u00a0is considered the benchmark number for comparing one company\u2019s stock price to another. The ratio is based on the current stock price divided by the trailing 12-month earnings per share. If a stock price is $10/share, and the P/E ratio is 10, it means that company is earning $1 per share. If you buy a $10 share with a P/E of 20, it\u2019ll roughly take you 20 years to break even.\n\nWarren Buffett likes to buy stocks with a P/E of around 12.

(That\u2019s\u00a0[$0.50 worth of earnings for every $300 invested](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/earnings). Would you buy a business with an ROI of 0.0015%? Would you acquire a company that will take 600+ years to break even?)\n\nSnap, Pinterest, Uber, and Airbnb don\u2019t even have a P/E ratio\u00a0*because you have to have some actual profits to measure against*.\n\n**Welcome to the Vampire Economy!**\n\nI\u2019m sick of \u201cdisruptors.\u201d Companies like Uber and Snap and Airbnb and Tesla are little more than\u00a0[story stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/storystock.asp). It took them a good idea and a metric ton of debt and private equity to strangled their competition. It made a few people very rich, and the wider society much poorer.\n\nThese aren\u2019t contributing companies \u2014 they\u2019re **predatory** corporations.\n\nAs someone wise once said:\n\n*The thing that gets me is that Uber and Lyft have never made a profit, yet they\u2019ve decimated the taxi industry and have destroyed the livelihoods of many while paying sub-minimum wages to their own drivers. All while using infrastructure they don\u2019t pay for, and changing labor laws (in CA) intended to help the people who work for them by paying millions of $ for calculated propaganda that could have gone to helping the people that work for them! These types of vampiric, exploitative, extraction dependent business models aren\u2019t long-term sustainable in reality and need to be eliminated because they do real damage to the world we all live in without returning any value to anyone but their shareholders. It\u2019s disgusting and evil.*\n\nShould society and the market really reward them for that?

        "selftext": "# How to Analyze a Company Quantitatively\n\nAlso see:\n\n* [How to Think about Stock Ownership](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/qpkyf2/how_to_think_about_stock_ownership/)\n* [How to Analyze a Business Qualitatively](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/rb4km3/how_to_analyze_a_business_qualitatively/)\n\n# Value Line\n\nValue Line is a great resource for looking through a lot of companies' financials. Your local library's website should grant you free access. There is also [roic.ai](https://roic.ai).\n\n**My eyes go straight to the revenue** to see whether they have doubled over the last 7 years. Using the Rule of 72, I know that if a company's sales have doubled in 7 years, that comes out to about a 10% growth rate. Why 10%? Because it's a nice round number. I'm probably not going to be interested if growth has been stagnant. But there are other things to consider. Have there been any acquisitions, divestitures, product cycles, or recessions? You can't just look at financial statements in a vacuum. **Consider where these numbers come from if you want to have any idea where they're going.**\n\nAre **margins** expanding, declining, or flat? Are the margins good? You can find good companies with bad margins. That can be because the company has a lot of turnover like Walmart or is still growing like Amazon. If you find a company with consistently good margins, then it's probably a good business. (Whether or not it's a good stock to own, is another story. We're going to get to valuation in the next episode.)\n\n**Balance sheet**. Check the company's net debt position. Take the company's total debt and then subtract cash and investments. I'm probably going to pass if net debt is over 5-10 times earnings. This is an arbitrary rule of thumb.\n\nValue Line also does a good job of normalizing numbers and giving you footnotes for their major adjustments. I don't recommend relying on Value Line's numbers for making investment decisions, but I do find them useful for screening.\n\n# 10Ks\n\nOur objective is a valuation and we just need three things: the company's look through earnings, a vague notion of a growth rate, and their net cash position. Look through earnings, aka core earnings or owner's earnings, are a normalized number to base our valuation on. Imagine a bank wanted to know your monthly income before approving your loan. You wouldn't include a stimulus check. You'd give your average monthly income. It's the same principle here.\n\n**Revenue** may seem like a pure number that doesn't require adjustment, but a lot of things can throw it off: **acquisitions, divestitures, product cycles, and recessions**. You need to adjust for those things. Then you'll want to break out revenue by product segment/geography. Understand each segment. What are the key drivers of growth for each segment? Typically, it's going to be price and volume. For example, for Netflix it's the price per subscription and the number of subscribers. And those things will be different across geographies.\n\n**Cost** changes will be explained in the reports. Head count is a common one. Sometimes there will be one-time events that will require your adjustment. For example, perhaps the company just paid a huge one-time fee to the FTC. Or maybe you don't believe that fine is a one time thing, and you want to adjust for legal fees in your earnings estimates. Or during COVID a lot of companies reduced their travel and ad spend. Read through all the expenses and figure out if anything requires an adjustment.\n\n**Other Income** includes interest on cash and investments. I remove this interest, but leave the interest on the company's debt. Long story short, I don't consider the cash and investments to be part of the company's core business. But I do consider making interest payments to be part of the core business. Feel free to disagree with me, this is just how I do it. Then there's Forex which usually isn't going to have a huge impact, but it's something to always look out for. Also, you will come across write-offs or write-ups. My favorite example is **Disney's 2019 fiscal year. They had bought more Hulu at a higher valuation than they had previously paid, so their investment in Hulu increased in value. This caused nearly $5B to be added to their bottom line.** Something like that is just accounting gimmickry and not part of the company's core earnings.\n\n**Taxes**. Be inquisitive if the tax rate is wildly different than previous years. Tax laws change. For example, a few years ago the Trump Tax Cut impacted a lot of tax rates. I believe the UK just passed a tax law thats had a major impact on some US companies. **In Microsoft's latest 10Q, they got a $3.3 billion tax refund because they moved some intangible properties from a Puerto Rican subsidiary to the US.** These things sometimes throw off your numbers if you're not careful.\n\n**Earnings. I add back depreciation and subtract maintenance CapEx and Financial Lease Repayments.** All of this can be found on the Cash Flow Statement. But notice how I said maintenance Capex. I don't like to penalize a company for growth Cap Ex. Companies aren't going to breakout capital expenditures by maintenance and growth. It's up to you to decide. Basically, earnings can either be returned to the shareholders as dividends and stock buybacks, they can be retained and just sit on the balance sheet earning low interest, or they can be reinvested back into the company as capital expenditures.\n\nIdeally, the money reinvested back into the business will grow at a satisfactory rate for you. You'd rather the company reinvest the money at 20% growth, then pay it out to you as a dividend. But if cap ex isn't going to generate a satisfactory return, then it makes sense to deduct it from future earnings. For example, the reason Facebook fell recently is because investors are worried that Mark Zuckerberg is going to invest tens of billions of dollars into virtual reality. Subtract those capital expenditures if you think they're a complete waste.\n\n**Forecasting**. I don't put a lot of stock in forecasts. 'Well sales have grown at 20% over the last 5 years, therefore sales are going to grow at 20% over the next 5 years.' **That's called a naive forecast**. Instead try to find a reasonable basis for your estimates. What is the total addressable market in terms of customers/dollars? Is it growing? Pay attention to similar companies to help paint a picture. Any forecast you do is going to be complete dog shit, but you at least want an idea.\n\nAlso, think about operating leverage. Sometimes a company can have shitty margins, but their costs are largely fixed. If their sales continue to grow, then a lot of money will start falling to the bottom line. Though, be careful because operating leverage can cut both ways. Or take a company like Netflix. Several years ago, they were spending a lot of money on international expansion and the sales weren't there yet. But those sales numbers kept growing, and the costs started to plateau, so you started to see operating income.  Don't just think about where the company has been, but think about where it's going. Though sometimes costs will stay around a certain percentage of revenue. Finally, **don't get crazy with your forecasts. A rough estimate is better than a precise guess.**\n\nAlright, I think that's been more than enough. Next episode we're going to talk about valuation. Have a great day.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n* [How to value a business](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/rim0b2/how_to_value_a_business/)\n\nYou can listen to this and other topics on my podcast, [How Not to Suck at the Stocks](https://soundcloud.com/user-650296856/070-investing-203?si=502c2f0acb994664902ab5444c48d1d0&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing).",

        "title": "ROIC: the best predictor of stock performance over the long term",
        "selftext": "Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is something that Charlie Munger pays very close attention to. He says that the return on invested capital over the long term is a great indicator of the rate of return that you can expect on your stock price appreciation.\n\nThere are different interpretations of ROIC. On a high level, ROIC is the ratio between the Net Income or Owner Earnings and the Invested Capital represented as a percentage. Obviously, the higher the percentage, the better, which means that the management of the company is doing a good job at allocating capital.\n\nIf you read the Intelligent Investor, on Chapter 15, you'll find a version of the ROIC formula according to Christopher Davis from the Davis Funds. He defines ROIC as Owner Earnings divided by the Invested Capital.\n\nAnother definition is the one from Investopedia, which I personally like better. Investopedia defines the ROIC as NOPAT or Net Operating Profit After Tax, or Net income minus Dividends, all divided by the Invested Capital, which equals to Equity plus Debt:\n\nROIC = (Net Income - Dividends) / (Equity + Debt - Cash &amp; Cash Eq)\n\nThe most important aspect of ROIC is its consistency, because over the long run, you can expect the rate of return of your stock to be as good as the return on invested capital. To illustrate this, I compiled some figures for Apple and Microsoft in the last 10 years:\n\n**Apple (AAPL)**\n\n|Year|ROIC|Avg Stock Price|% price change|EBITDA (Bi)|% EBITDA change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011||$11.14||||\n|2012|42.01%|$17.68|58.64%|$58.52||\n|2013|26.08%|$14.80|\\-16.30%|$57.05|\\-2.51%|\n|2014|26.20%|$20.71|39.95%|$61.81|8.34%|\n|2015|31.32%|$27.40|32.32%|$84.51|36.73%|\n|2016|21.95%|$24.37|\\-11.05%|$73.33|\\-13.23%|\n|2017|19.86%|$35.74|46.64%|$76.57|4.42%|\n|2018|24.41%|$45.57|27.49%|$87.05|13.69%|\n|2019|25.75%|$51.00|11.90%|$81.86|\\-5.96%|\n|2020|30.11%|$94.46|85.23%|$81.02|\\-1.03%|\n|2021|51.70%|$136.31|44.30%|$123.14|51.99%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT)**\n\n|Year|ROIC|Avg Stock Price|% price change|EBITDA (Bi)|% EBITDA change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011||$20.91||||\n|2012|23.25%|$24.59|17.60%|$25.61||\n|2013|25.70%|$27.63|12.37%|$31.24|21.98%|\n|2014|21.79%|$37.15|34.43%|$33.63|7.65%|\n|2015|11.16%|$41.96|12.96%|$25.25|\\-24.92%|\n|2016|14.81%|$51.00|21.55%|$27.62|9.39%|\n|2017|16.36%|$68.10|33.53%|$34.15|23.64%|\n|2018|11.49%|$97.42|43.04%|$49.47|44.86%|\n|2019|22.69%|$127.59|30.98%|$58.06|17.36%|\n|2020|23.90%|$190.83|49.56%|$68.42|17.84%|\n|2021|30.80%|$266.16|39.48%|$85.13|24.42%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summary**\n\n|Last 10 years (annualized)|AAPL|MSFT|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Avg ROIC per year|29.94%|20.20%|\n|Avg % stock price increase per year|30.54%|28.45%|\n|Avg % EBITDA increase per year|10.27%|15.80%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see above, Apple had an annualized increase in EBITDA of 10.27% over the last 10 years, while annualized ROIC was 29.94%. The stock price annualized performance is 30.54%, which is very close to ROIC. Therefore, ROIC indeed proves itself as an accurate indicator of stock price performance.\n\nSimilarly, with Microsoft we can see that the annualized increase of 15.80% in EBITDA is higher than Apple's over the last 10 years, however ROIC is 20.20%. Microsoft's stock price annualized performance is 28.45%, which isn't as close to ROIC as with Apple's example, but still, it demonstrates the correlation, especially considering that Microsoft had a greater increase in revenue YoY than Apple.\n\nAnother point that Charlie Munger makes is that it doesn't matter much your entry price when building a position in a stock if over the long term there is consistent ROIC. At the end of the day, after 10, 15, 20 years, the rate of return on the stock and the ROIC performance will converge.\n\nEdit: forgot to add minus Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents in the denominator of the formula",

The man not only built a lasting empire but he illuminated the way for many other through his philosophy and wisdom (along with Charlie Munger). \n\nI noticed often people talk about Warren Buffett in a \u201chas been\u201d manner yet think of  DCF and CAPM as modern inventions that alluded Buffett. They say that his time in the sun is over and with that his teachings are now archaic. Some say that he has turned into an index investor and while others mock those that try to become value investors these days. Often those posts and opinions are downvoted on this sub but elsewhere they thrive because people don\u2019t get it.\n\nI think people have this idea that Warren was teaching a specific way of investing, like it\u2019s a trick that when you learn it you know the holy grail. Others have gone on to finance and MBA schools and they\u2019re taught case studies after case studies of market efficiency and they believe in what they have gone in huge debt for. There\u2019s a real emotional struggle to accept an out-dated philosophy vs the Greeks and EBITDA taught in modern schools. When you have to pay off that debt every month, that\u2019s a reminder that you should carry on the school\u2019s thinking instead of abandoning it for something accessible to the masses.\n\nI understand as I am also that person. The reason why I am thankful to Warren is because he ignited a passion in me for learning about individual businesses and what makes them run - economics of the business ; he talked about taking emotions out of the market and putting emotions into your due diligence of price vs value; he talked about value beyond the quantitative factors but at the same time made a fortune through just the quantitative analysis. Finally, he preached what he practiced and so he showed me the importance of discipline by sticking to a tested strategy and sitting on his ass just catching up on reading voraciously to further his due diligence. Basically, he didn\u2019t teach me any formulas, he didn\u2019t teach me any particular discount rates, he didn\u2019t teach me portfolio allocations, he didn\u2019t teach me the right from wrong. He taught me how the anchor of \u201cValue\u201d is the best possible way to analyze a business, stock, real estate, school, job, career, family and so on and so forth. \n\nThe man is getting older but I believe he has paid back humanity by sharing his wisdom and philosophy; and illuminated the way in the age of \u201copinionated, theoretical and hypothetical\u201d excess knowledge that stops you before you even get started.",

However, within these segments the Abrasives, Advanced Materials, Aerospace, and Oral Care performed the worst, declining 15%, 17%, 16%, and 19% respectively.\n\n\u00b7 **Q3 2021 Financial Performance (Good):** In Q3 2021, 3M increased their net income by 0.3%, which might not sound good, however, considering 3M\u2019s operating income decreased in this time period any increase in net income is great. Furthermore, 3M was able to keep their EPS (basic and diluted) constant during this time, which is again good considering their decline in operating income.\n\n\u00b7 **Q3 2021 Financial Performance (Bad):** In Q3 2021, 3M increased their net sales by 7% YoY, now you may be wondering \u201chow is this bad\u201d? Well, during this same period, 3M increased their operating expenses by 11%, which contributes to a lower operating margin. This can be seen by their YoY decline in operating income of 6%\n\n\u00b7 **Share Repurchasing:** In the first 3 quarters of 2021 (Jan 1 \u2013 September 30th), 3M reported repurchasing 6,675,484 at an average cost basis of $190.88/share (totalling $1.27B worth of shares repurchased). This would have increased the value of existing shares by approximately 1.2%, which is a great sign for longer term investors.\n\n***Investment Valuation:***\n\n*Comparable Analyses: (Spreadsheet found at the end of this analysis)*\n\nBy comparing 3M\u2019s financial ratios to that of their publicly listed competition (listed above in the \u201ccompetitors\u201d section) I found the following: \n\n*PE Ratio:* \n\nBased off of 3M\u2019s Price to Earnings Ratio in comparison to their competitors, $MMM should be valued at $232.72/share, which would imply a share price increase of 29%. This is a little high, so I decided to take another comparable.\n\n*P/B Ratio:*\n\n3M\u2019s P/B ratio (compared to their counterparts) indicates that their fair value is $143.52/share, which would translate into a downside risk of 20%. This is a little low and contradicts the results achieved via the P/E comparable.\n\n*EV/Revenue Ratio:*\n\n3M\u2019s EV/Revenue ratio indicates that their fair value is $174.82/share, which would translate into a small downside of 3%. This is the most realistic estimate of the 3 comparable analyses, however I decided to take the average of the three comparable analyses to have one comparable price target.\n\n*Comparable Valuation:*\n\nBased off of the above comparable analyses, I landed on one final (comparable) valuation of $183.69/share, which would imply an increase of 2%. This indicates that 3M is very close to their fair value.\n\n*DCF: (Visualization found at the end of this analysis)*\n\nBy inputting the necessary data into my DCF model, it arrived at a fair valuation of $MMM stock of $205/share, which implies a potential upside to this investment of 14%. This is pretty close to the result as achieved in my comparable valuation, which indicates that 3M is sitting at/around their fair value and has a little bit of room to run up.\n\n*Dividend Discount Model: (Visual at the end of this analysis)*\n\nMy dividend discount model uses the current annual dividend amount in combination with 3M\u2019s average annual dividend growth (over the past 4 years), and their WACC (as found in the DCF model). By using these metrics, I was able to find 3M\u2019s fair value to be $203/share, which implies an upside of 13%. Once again this is very close to their current fair value, which indicates that 3M is a decent buy.\n\n*Overall Valuation:*\n\nIn order to provide simplicity, I wanted to come to one final, all-encompassing valuation for the $MMM stock. I did this through taking the average valuation of the Average Comparable, the DCF, and the Dividend Discount Model. By doing this I arrived at a price target for the $MMM stock of $197/share, which implies an upside of 9.5%.\n\n***Investment Plan:***\n\nMy plan for an investment in the $MMM stock would go as follows: \n\n\u00b7 Enter into a position below the fair value, preferably at/below $180/share.\n\n\u00b7 Hold long-term (with dividend re-investment)\n\n\u00b7 Re-evaluate the position as new data is released (especially the 10-Q (quarterly) and 10-K (annual) reports).\n\n***Risks:***\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** In 2020, and Q3 2021, there were a few concerning metrics that arose from their financial statements. These include their cost of good sold out-pacing their revenue growth (means margins are shrinking). If these trends continue, it could invalidate my DCF model, and their fair value would be lower than I estimated.\n\n***Catalysts:***\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** In 2020 and Q3 of 2021, 3M reported decent earnings, but there are still areas to improve upon in order to attract more investors, and potentially increase the share price. Firstly, their net income has been steadily increasing (which is good), despite their operating income either increasing or decreasing. If they can find a way to keep their operating income to consistently grow,, translating in higher increases in their net incomes this would be good.\n\n\u00b7 **Share Repurchasing:** Over the past couple of years, 3M has been repurchasing more shares than they have been issuing. This is a very good trend for investors to note, as every year their shares represent a larger stake in their company. These repurchases help investors to return more on their invested capital",

        "title": "Why the Markets are Bugging Out &amp; Why Value Investing will Benefit from Uncertain Market Conditions",
        "selftext": "# What Investors Fear\n\n**Increasing Treasury Bond Yields:** Happens when the demand for Treasuries (Which the Fed has been buying on the secondary market) goes down. The Fed has been tapering (meaning buying less and less every month ... not selling), which will decrease the overall demand for Treasury Bonds. To incentivize bond buying, the yields will therefore need to go up ... meaning less money in the stock market as folks run for the safety of Treasury Bonds. If you are asking why anyone would settle for the low rates of treasuries with inflation so high, see the current market.\n\nAt [current tapering rates](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/treasury-securities/treasury-securities-operational-details) the Fed has one or two months of tapering left. Remember that tapering is simply buying less. After completion they will begin offloading their balance sheet by selling treasuries ... which will have an effect on yields! Therefore, the more the yields increase, the more investors will be incentivized to put money in safe treasuries as opposed to the riskier market. The Fed has thus far gone from buying $80b in treasuries per month prior to November to buying only $40b in mid January. Expect $20b in February and perhaps zero in March.\n\n**Inflation:**\n\n* **Pricing out Consumers:** Investors fear that rising inflation will price out consumers. In short, consumers with the same or slightly increased income, will resort to economizing on their needs and cutting back on their wants (As a result of higher prices). And the sales &amp; consumer spending data seems to suggest this is slowly happening. It's a very real threat, and perhaps the largest one to current markets.\n* **High Prices/Less Demand:** Businesses will be attempting to get the same, or increased, market share with less demand (less demand due to increased prices). That's a tall order! And in highly competitive markets this will result in heavy advertising, lest they lose out to their competition. This will come at a very real cost to businesses.\n* **Low Labor Supply/High Labor Costs:** As prices increase and the quantity of labor remains low, businesses will be competing for a limited labor pool forcing them to increase wages to attract the labor they need to remain competitive (Labor will also demand more buying power as a result of inflation). This too will come at a cost to businesses, as labor is generally the number one expense for any enterprise. However the increase in wages always lags behind inflation, and often results in bumping people up in higher tax brackets ... even though they already have less buying power. This is why Congress loves inflation. Congressional pay is tied to inflation so THEY don't lose out, yet as people make more nominally they are taxed more nominally, affording the government a higher nominal tax revenue to pay down existing debt or implement more spending. Therefore people will not only have less buying power because of inflation, but less buying power because of taxes as well. This is why inflation is considered a \"hidden tax,\" or, \"a tax no one had to vote for.\"\n* **It isn't ALL Bad:** The good part of inflation is that over time, current debt will be easier to pay back. Example: Lets say you bought a home 30 years ago with a 30 year fixed when the median home price was $66,400. If you are still making the mortgage payments today, even when considering the higher interest rates of the 80's, the payment would be exceptionally easy to make as compared to 30 years ago. Indeed, depending on the interest rate the mortgage would be between $300-$400 per month .... whereas the same mortgage today with the median home price of $404,700, would cost you roughly $1,800-$2,100 per month. This applies to business and government debt too (Government debt because as wages inevitably increase the government gets more tax revenue). The more inflation increases the easier it is to pay back long term debt. In this respect, business will benefit.\n* **How Institutions &amp; Funds will Adjust:** To mitigate inflation, institutions (who run the bulk of the stock market) will keep a solid cash balance, reorganize their portfolios into less risky (albeit less profitable) assets, take less risk in unprofitable companies (Or barely profitable companies), buy more profitable companies, buy less companies trading many multiples beyond current earnings, and buy more companies trading at a value price. Therefore pay attention to companies with a low trailing/forward P/E (&lt;20/10), a low P/S (&lt;1), a low PEG (&lt;1), a current ratio of (1.25-4), with a (market cap &lt; enterprise value), a low BVPS (1-2.5 depending on the company/sector \\[tech &amp; growth trade at many multiples\\]), a PB of 2.5 or less, a positive cash flow, etc.\n\n**Inevitable Increase in Interest Rates:** The Fed will inevitably increase interest rates making borrowing more expensive. Right now interest rates are nearly zero while in 2019, prior to the pandemic, they were as high as 2.5. The higher the cost of borrowing becomes the less folks will borrow to include both people and business. Thereby slowing money creation and purchases on credit (meaning drying up consumer demand).  I don't know about you folks but I think 2019 was a good year, and I don't fear incrementally slow interest rate hikes. The first interest rate hike is expected this quarter. Fed Chair Powell has committed to doing this slowly. Many analysts expect a half percent increase initially and a quarter thereafter as subsequent hikes happen throughout the year. The next Fed interest rate decision is on January 26th and can be seen highlighted on the economic calendar above. There is some doubt that they will raise rates before they're finished tapering but we will see.\n\nHigher interest rates bodes well for banks, credit institutions, and payment processors. Expect your margin rates to increase.\n\n**Analyst Downgrades:** Now that every analyst on Wall Street is officially wrong (Nothing new here) with their 12 month price target outlook, expect the downgrades to come rolling in (In many cases to save face). Especially after their intuitions offload their portfolios freeing them up to downgrade companies they once held (Right before earnings too). A cynical view ... I know ... but those of us who remember the housing crisis remember that intuitions didn't begin downgrading mortgage backed securities until they themselves mitigated the risk or established a net short position. Criminal? Yes! Did the SEC care? nope!\n\n**Despite all of the Lockdowns, Vaccinations, &amp; Stimulus, Covid is Spreading Strong:** Yes I don't know what else to say ... the title says it all. More infections, more deaths year over year. And God knows what new variant will shake the markets. The last variant \"Omicron\" had spread worldwide before it was discovered. And yet governments attempted to restrict travel/commerce to prevent the spread when Omicron was already being spread in their respective countries all the same. Leave it to the experts to fail so spectacularly. The prospect of incurring economic harm on people with faulty information remains a risk. However, there will be very little political capital moving forward to implement more lockdowns and travel restrictions. It's political suicide at this point.\n\n**Now For the Perspective:** Remember that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy are strong, government is slightly divided (by party) so there's little congress can do to screw things up, and the action the government and the Fed took to mitigate covid was not a result of any particular market flaw in need of correction. Publicly traded companies made out like bandits while small mom and pop shops got hammered which gave the big guys a larger part of the market share. Incremental increases in interest rates should do little to affect the markets initially, although over time should have a substantial effect on inflation. Consumer spending over time will be harmed by increased prices, but if you stick to profitable companies trading at a value and are willing to hold for a bit, this should not be an issue and you'll at minimum get your money back if not make more. Remember that a profitable company is a growing company and no matter what the EPS, so as long as the company is 1. turning a positive net cashflow from sales, and 2. profit margins exceed inflation, they are in fact adding to their overall net value. And that increase in net value over time is the number one indicator that the stock will go higher.\n\n# Why Value is the Way Forward\n\n**How to Invest in THIS Uncertain Market:**\n\n**Stay Away From**\n\n1. Companies trading many many years beyond current earnings\n2. Unprofitable Companies\n3. Barely profitable companies\n4. Companies in highly competitive markets\n5. Companies with little to no pricing power\n6. Companies that produce goods and services in low demand\n\n**Buy**\n\n1. Profitable value with a profit margin that exceeds inflation\n2. Companies that we cant do without\n3. Companies with pricing power\n4. Companies with a large economic moat\n5. Companies that have solid and well established name recognition\n6. Companies that produce goods and services in high demand\n\nInvestors will have a decision to make. Will they want to buy overpriced &amp; high flying memes in tech \u2026 or will they want to buy reliably profitable value buys that have limited downside as a result of being so irresistible at lower valuations that they will likely be swallowed up by intuitions. And value that gets swallowed up by intuitions has the tendency to get overbought akin to how many stocks are oversold now \u2026 which can lead to amazing upside swings. Indeed while other folks fear the road ahead, I assess that I\u2019m holding some solid value stocks that will be coveted by intuitions looking for safety.\n\n**THE BENEFITS OF RELIABLY PROFITABLE VALUE WITH GOOD INSTITIONAL INVESTMENT AMID MARKET CHAOS:**\n\n* **Limited Downside:** There\u2019s only so far they can usually go before they become irresistible to others. They\u2019re already at a value, they\u2019re already on a pullback, intuitions already favor them, &amp; we know they\u2019re profitable regardless of earnings.\n* **Insider Buying:** Insiders are more likely to buy their own stock when its trading at a discount.\n* **Buyout Potential:** Over the past year I accidently bought a number of companies that ended up getting bought out \u2026 largely because the market didn\u2019t respect the value of the stocks or consider their growth, although giant corporations did. Such examples include little known stocks such as **ECHO**, **STMP**, **ATVI**, &amp; **SPWH**. **ATVI** was good for a 44% gain as a result, more than making up for the current market turmoil.\n* **There\u2019s Safety in Profit &amp; Value:** In poor markets, investors abandon over-valued memes &amp; tech, &amp; search for safety in value &amp; profitability. Risky companies with a market cap well above enterprise value, high PE ratios, high PS ratios, trading many multiples in book value, have poor cash flow, high debt, or are barely profitable typically suffer the most amid general market uncertainty.\n* **Probability of Profit is Historically Higher in Bearish Markets:** When we buy value we are attempting to limit our risk by at minimum putting ourselves in a position to not lose money, while at maximum wagering others will see the value we do. Ladies &amp; Gents, I believe this is the year for picking up value!\n* **Share Buybacks Are AWESOME when you Buy Value:** Indeed if a stock is already trading at a value, share buybacks significantly increase that value.\n\nTip: Remember, if you are fine with buying in 100 share blocks you can always sell cash secured puts. This will enable you to either get a stock for a lower price (higher value) or benefit from the upside if the stock swings ... if you are willing to carry the contract to term.\n\nTip: In this market establish your position and average down only every 10% with a good chink of change to the side. Consider anything less than 10% red a minor inconvenience. This will help maximize your buying power &amp; minimize your cost basis. This way you'll also have the exposure you need for a violent rebound or money to buy the dip for even more value.\n\nIt may not be evident now, it may not even be evident next week ([Note: on the 26th at 2:30 ET the FED will release their interest rate decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/s9uql0/this_weeks_economic_calendar_most_anticipated/)) but big money will very likely be looking for the sanctuary of value in this market in the near future.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: It is important to actually read the notes within earnings reports and sec filings because they will help explain the numbers you see on financial statements.\n\nHello all! While this is basic accounting for some, I understand that there are newer folks on this subreddit who may like to see something like this. So Amazon just put out their Q4/Full Year 2021 earnings and one of the crazy headlines you may see is the earnings per share (EPS) beat. Most of the estimates I saw ranged between $**3.50** \\- $**3.90** for the EPS estimates for Q4 2021. It was a huge surprise when they put up a diluted EPS of $**27.75** for the quarter. To find the answer for why this was a huge beat I point you to the excerpt down below.\n\n&gt;Excerpt from Amazon's earnings release today:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Fourth Quarter 2021*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Net income*** *increased to $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter, or $27.75 per diluted share, compared with $7.2 billion, or $14.09 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2020. Fourth quarter 2021 net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion included in non-operating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November.*\n\nThis is an example of the point that the net income is now fluctuating due to the paper value Rivian. Warren Buffett is not a huge fan of having to include this paper value in the net income because you end up with net income that was not truly booked in the sense that we think of making a profit. Sure Amazon could sell their Rivian stake for a good chunk of profit, but the holding itself won't generate cash flow on its own unless the start issuing some dividends, etc.\n\nNow for a new investor, this shows it is important to read the notes on earnings reports and/or the 10K or 10Q's for this very reason. Also, actually analyzing the financial statements to understand what each section is including. For a novice, they make look at this and think \"hey Amazon suddenly sold a ton more and generated a ton of profit\" which will cause you to overvalue their true profitability when going through your analysis.\n\nThank you for the read and please let me know if I missed anything.\n\nEdit: In case the point of this post was missed....I am agnostic to these earnings. I was simply using Amazon's earnings as an example.",

        "selftext": "Last week, [I made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/smg7ev/what_are_5_stocks_youd_like_me_to_research/).  Sadly, it was removed, but I still got a lot of suggestion in time and had some leads to research.  The 5 were: BABA, F, HOOD, RIO, and YUMC.  The format shall proceed like so:\n\n* Summary of Operations\n* Strategy\n* Growth and the Future\n* Valuation\n\nWhile deeper analysis is possible for some of these, the goal is a concise elevator pitch, in line with what Peter Lynch recommends when making decisions to buy or sell.  I included everything that I thought should satisfy a curious investor.  ***Once you're done, give me 5 more to research.***\n\n# BABA\n\n**Summary of Operations**\n\nAlibaba is large, diverse, Chinese company with its own ecosystem of different enterprises it has developed or acquired. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\n* Core Commerce (86% Revenue):\n   * Retail Commerce (Taobao and Tmall in China; Lazada, Kaola, and Daraz beyond)\n   * Wholesale Commerce (Lingshoutong in China; Alibaba.com beyond)\n   * Logistics Services (Cainiao and Fengniao)\n   * Consumer Services (Ele.me, Koubei, Fliggy)\n* Cloud Computing (8% Revenue) : Alibaba Cloud\n* Digital Media and Entertainment (4% Revenue): Youku, Alibaba Pictures\n* Innovation Initiatives: DingTalk, Amap\n\nSeveral of these assets on their own are highly cash generative, experience high growth rates, have immense customer appeal, and are among the largest commercial platforms in the world. Thus, with a model similar to that of Amazon (also has individually popular enterprises in online and offline retail, shipping, entertainment media), the company offers a wide array of goods and services under a \u201csingle roof\u201d that provide economies of scale, cost reduction, and convenience for the customer.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nAlibaba aims to increase the variety of its product offerings in order to draw in new customers outside of China and to draw more revenues from existing customers. For enterprises it acquires, it integrates them into its vertical operations, internal supply chains, cloud system, data analysis\u2014all of which lead to operational optimization.\n\nWith low levels of debt and plenty of its own cash, Alibaba is continually adding to its existing infrastructure and maintains self-sufficiency.\n\n**Growth and the Future**\n\nEach of Alibaba\u2019s assets are among the most globally popular, reputable enterprises of their kind and are leading the way in China\u2019s and Southeast Asia\u2019s consumer markets. By possessing these in a single ecosystem in developing economies, Alibaba is positioned to enjoy a windfall of cash from a rising middle class in the East. The company has over a billion customers now and aims to achieve 2 billion in the early 2030s.\n\nWhile there is risk from Chinese regulators cracking down and trade relations with the world being unpredictable, this has always been the case for Alibaba and not impeded its ability to grow. I\u2019ve read annual reports of companies who are limited and at the mercy of regulators in their section on Risk Factors, and this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here. While everyone is theoretically at the mercy of Xi Jinping in China, even this company, the real question is if he will think it is worth it to smash a player that is bringing his country into a golden age.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nEven with conservative assumptions, BABA appears undervalued. The company made $26 billion in free cash flow for the year ended March 31, 2021. While financial data for the year ending March 2022 has yet to come in, the current, quarterly data suggests that $20 billion very achievable. The company has been growing around 30% as well, which can\u2019t last forever, but we can price in declining growth.\n\n* Growth Assumption: 20% first five years, 15% next five.\n* Intrinsic Value Per Share: $195\n\n# F\n\n**Summary of Operations**\n\nFord Motor Company is an American automobile manufacturer and financing company that sells cars and parts to independent dealerships around the world. Brands consist of Ford, Lincoln, and Ford-Lincoln. The company sold 8.1 million vehicles in 2021, with 52% sold in North America, 24% in Europe, and 15% in China. The autoindustry is cyclical, and Ford has had declining revenues the last few years. It typically accounts for about 12% of the North American market and 5% of the global market.\n\nFord Credit provides financing services and assists dealers in the sale of new cars. Most of its revenue comes from interest on retail installment sales and finance leasing. Ford is the only of the Big Three American car manufacturers that owns its own financing company, so while its balance sheet reports high levels of debt, most of this attributable to Ford Credit (high debt levels are normal for financial entities).\n\n**Strategy**\n\nFord maintains a steady flow of car sales by maintaining the strength of its brand and operating globally. It retains relationships with dealers through the convenience of Ford Credit\u2019s financing services. It hopes to build on these strengths with improved data analysis and integration of new tech into new models, as part of a \u201cGlobal Redesign\u201d project stemming back to 2018.\n\n**Growth and the Future**\n\nWhile Ford is a legacy brand, there is no obvious path for growth for such a mature company, nor does it have a moat or competitive advantage. It has the value of its brand and the ability to make decent cars, but several competitors have this as well. It depends the sale of larger vehicles for greater profitability, and it worries that a transition to smaller, electric vehicles (either from consumer demand or regulation) will limit its profitability going forward. Ford is also vulnerable to supply disruptions, and the semiconductor shortage has materially limited its productivity.\n\n**Valuation**\n\n* Growth Assumptions: 0%\n* Intrinsic Value Per Share: $7.50 - $17\n\nThis is tricky. Using more normal ways to calculate free cash flow above, Ford is fairly valued. The adjusted free cash flows Ford has started providing the last few years (to rule out operating cash flows from Ford Credit) suggest only about half of current FCF.  This might actually make more sense, as financial companies\u2019 operating cash flows are usually bad for valuation.  We could then also try to go by book value (and per share growth thereof) to account for that.  No matter what, Ford appears to be, at best, fairly valued.\n\n# HOOD\n\n**Summary of Operations**\n\nRobinhood is a company with an online trading app that allows users to buy and sell assets for the purposes of investment and speculation, with the aspiration to \u201cdemocratize finance.\u201d It primarily draws revenues from transaction fees and receives marginal earnings from interest. The company intends to offer more than just trading services, being an ecumenical app for all financial needs, as a digital wallet, a bank account, and so on.\n\nThe company consistently operated at a loss from 2013 to 2019. Cash flows are currently negative, largely because operating expenses skyrocketed over the last year (up 266%), while revenues did not keep up pace (up only 89%). HOOD is a new stock, going public last July, and the company has raised about $2 billion in capital, which it must deploy intelligently in order to address these concerns.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nThe company entices sign-ups with up to $500 of free stocks for referrals, similar to what a lot of digital wallets do with free money. From there, it hopes that the convenience of its app will draw people in and allow for several transactions. If it can integrate more financial services into its app, the convenience should increase, as should more sources of revenue.\n\n**Growth and the Future**\n\nI am skeptical of this company. Being the go-to finance app is a big ambition, and Robinhood really hurt its brand with how it handled the GME Squeeze last year. For those unaware, it halted trading for users in a way that (arguably) benefited hedge funds, potentially causing millions of dollars in losses for their own customers. Ouch.\n\nLooking aside that temporary setback, let\u2019s analyze their mission. They aim to \u201cdemocratize finance,\u201d and I believe this mission is already accomplished by other entities. For one, much of finance occurs in a market of companies whose shares are tradeable to public and whose shares are frequently split to make them affordable for a normal paycheck. That alone does most of their mission for them, and this has been a fact of life for more than a century, thanks to the laws of Western governments.\n\nTwo, plenty of other big names have always been \u201cdemocratized.\u201d First, banks let you write checks. Then they made ATMs. Then they made debit cards. They created websites where you could access your accounts. Many of these banks have since acquired or spun off investment firms as well, and other brokers like Vanguard and Fidelity have apps. Robinhood creates no clear value to give it a moat.\n\nI think the GME Squeeze (and the huge rise of Opex) is a sign that the founders of Robinhood are in over their heads with a starry-eyed goal that they can\u2019t execute, in spite of their growth in new accounts. To the extent that they democratize finance, it\u2019s by making the gambling aspect of \u201cinvesting\u201d easier, and considering how many of these users joined in the middle of an asset bubble, I wonder if Robinhood will have many eager customers for all those transaction fees when it pops.\n\nRead Peter Lynch. His parents\u2019 generation was traumatized by stocks because of Black Tuesday and the Great Depression. Even after the Nifty Fifties, there weren\u2019t a lot of people who trusted stocks. That\u2019s the headwind that Robinhood and many companies with similar business models face. Where casinos and video game loot boxes are still fun for the gambler, markets are not.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nBecause I do not see a future for this company, I will not perform a valuation.\n\n# RIO\n\n**Summary of Operations**\n\nRio Tinto owns and operates mines across the world that produce a variety of metal ores but primarily derives its income from the sale of iron and aluminum. The company has low debt, finances growth with its own cash, and pays most earnings to shareholders through dividends.\n\nHere is a description of their more prominent assets.\n\n* Iron: Pilbara Region, Australia, network of 16 mines, produces Pilbara Blend iron, nearly all of company\u2019s Operating Cash Flows. Highly automated (efficiency, minimal injuries).\n* Aluminum: A series of mines, smelters, and refineries in Canada for production of aluminum, alumina, and bauxite.\n* Copper: They are currently working on an untapped copper project in Arizona, which they believe could meet about 25% of American copper demand, which continues to rise in demand.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nSince Rio mines and sells commodities, the key idea is to lower costs and to invest capital to achieve that, so that if commodity prices crash, they are still profitable\u2014which the company tends to accomplish. Rio seeks to return value to shareholders primarily with dividends, typically at a payout ratio of 73% of earnings. This is the likely reason that current yield is 8.75%. While they don\u2019t retain much for reinvestment, they do seem to make use of extra cash as prices rise to pay off debt and keep the balance sheet healthy, a good sign.\n\nThey use on-site power plants (typically hydro and solar) to meet their electrical needs and consistently reduce workplace injuries. About 22,000 (50%) of their employees are shareholders of the company, suggesting labor is reasonably aligned with the success of operations. Similarly, executive compensation is very structured and tied to productivity. This seems like a well-run company.\n\n**Growth and the Future**\n\nThe average operational lifetime of their current sites is about 17 years each, so cash flows should be stable. Growth will likely come from rising demand and higher prices for iron and aluminum globally as more countries industrialize and urbanize, along with acquisitions of new mining assets. About five new sites will be operational in the next five years.\n\nMuch of current capex is on the copper assets, which are largely undeveloped. This is a project worth following, as the returns could be huge.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nWith the high yield and payout ratio, it make sense to value this as a dividend stock.\n\n* Growth Assumptions: 6%\n* Intrinsic Value Per Share: $74\n\n# YUMC\n\n**Summary of Operations**\n\nYum China (YUMC) is an American restaurant company that operates in China. It holds branding rights for similar assets held by its sister company, Yum Brands, as well as its own, which include: Kentucky Friend Chicken, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang, COFFii &amp; JOY, East Dawning, and Lavazza.\n\nThey have over 11,000 restaurants in China, most of which are owned directly by YUMC, while about 16% are franchised. KFC is the flagship brand, first opening in China in 1987 and becoming the most popular fast-food chain in the country, with over 7,000 locations.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nThe company decides each restaurant\u2019s location based on its individual merits, taking into account the area, financial potential, and impact to similar stores. All of its brands are supported by a common supply chain that has 25 logistics centers throughout China and vets the food and ingredients for quality.\n\nThe company claims to have identified 700 cities without a KFC or Pizza Hut and believes it can expand to 20,000 restaurants. It will add new locations of its existing brands and acquire more that it can incorporate into its ecosystem. Existing sites are well maintained to give customers a comfortable environment; 75% of KFC locations were built or renovated in the last five years.\n\nTechnology streamlines the customer service on top of this. Stores take payments on common platforms like Alipay and WeChat, making them very accessible. Online payments have also made delivery services very successful and are a growing revenue source. AI analyzes workflows to improve scheduling and inventory.\n\nWith a strong balance sheet, the company sustains its operations with its own cash.\n\n**Growth and the Future**\n\nThe company\u2019s growth lies in expanding its number of stores and eliminating costs by hybridizing its assets. It gained 1,286 stores in 2021 alone, so expansion to 20,000 seems reachable, yet this was on gross of 1,806 new stores. Why are they down almost 500 stores? That\u2019s a lot of lost capex.\n\nConcurrently, operating cash flows remain flat over the last few years. The latest quarterly earnings presentation emphasized new stores and expansion of delivery operations, but its glided over disappointing revenues.\n\nNew stores have been growing at a rate of about 8% per year. Even with the emerging middle class of China, the YUMC doesn\u2019t seem to raking in that growth when it comes to the hard numbers. The company will need to realize more customers for these expansions to bear fruit. When will that happen?\n\n**Valuation**\n\n* Growth Assumption: 8% first 5 years, 6% second 5\n* Intrinsic Value Per Share: $8.54\n\nI think this is a good company, but the market wants to pay for more cash than it is delivering. With a P/E multiple of 30, one would hope to see comparable growth.",

        "selftext": "Recently, [I made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/smg7ev/what_are_5_stocks_youd_like_me_to_research/). Later, I followed up [with this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/sr24fm/you_gave_me_5_stocks_to_research_here_are_the/). From those suggestions, the 5 stocks this time are: CLF, CROX, INTC, KR, and THOR.  The format shall proceed like so:\n\n* Summary of Operations\n* Strategy\n* Growth and the Future\n* Valuation\n\nWhile deeper analysis is possible for some of these, the goal is a concise elevator pitch, in line with what Peter Lynch recommends when making decisions to buy or sell. I included everything that I thought should satisfy a curious investor.  **Edit: $1.5 billion in CLF piece.  Was a typo.**\n\n^(Also, should have clarified last time.  Each of these valuations assumes a 10% discount rate.)\n\n# CLF\n\n**Summary of Operations**\n\nCleveland Cliffs (CLF) is a leading, American steel manufacturer. It employs a vertical operation, with enterprises that mine iron ore or acquire scrap metal. These raw materials are processed down the line into steel products, and excess raw materials are sold to other producers. Customers primarily use their products for:\n\n* Automobiles\n* Infrastructure and manufacturing, which includes electrical power\n* Distributors and converters\n* Other steel production\n\nAdditionally, most of these customers are North American. About 45% of sales are under fixed-price contracts that typically last a year.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nTheir vertical model makes them self-sufficient among the community of steel manufacturers and gives them a competitive advantage. For example, when the semiconductor shortage reduced automobile production and thus steel sales there, they were able to redirect of their steel volume to other customers. Even so, they experienced a decline in revenues from a major event like COVID in 2020.\n\nNevertheless, the recent acquisitions, vertical model, strong relationship with employees, and ability to adapt to new products, make CLF a strong business.\n\n**Growth and the Future**\n\nThere are many factors to consider here. On the one hand, government spending on infrastructure will directly benefit CLF, and as more of the worlds urbanizes and develops, more of the world will need CLF\u2019s goods.\n\nOn the other hand, loosening of beneficial trade restrictions could let in cheaper steel products and capture part of their market. Increase in fuel costs (they rely heavily on fossil fuels for electrical needs) and the rise of lighter alternatives to steel in auto-manufacturing could depress sales.\n\nThese considerations in mind, modest growth seems possible.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nWith recent acquisitions, annual free cash flow of $1.5 billion seems possible.\n\n* Growth Assumptions: 5%\n* Intrinsic Value Per Share: $27\n\n# CROX\n\n**Summary of Operations**\n\nCrocs, Inc. is a producer of casual footwear, mainly known for their product, the \u201ccroc,\u201d a clog known for its flamboyantly bizarre appearance, high comfort for the foot, and low cost for the buyer.\n\nOver the last five years, the company has both grown its revenues and operating margins, with a majority of sales (62%) occurring in the Americas. It sells its shoes to wholesalers, through its own retail stores, and through digital sales (the latter of which experienced significant growth after COVID). Its production is globalized, but most of it occurs in China and Vietnam.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nCrocs\u2019s strategy is centralized on the strength of its brand and patents. The recognizable nature of the croc, supercharged with marketing and merchandising opportunities, make it unique in the world of shoe sales. Not very many brands, down to a specific type of shoe, are this well known. The croc is cartoonishly ugly, the kind that makes it fun to wear, as if to say to everyone, \u201cI don\u2019t care about what you like; I care about what I like.\u201d This conceit is further bolstered by the comfort of the shoe and its practicality (waterproof and odor-proof).\n\nThe balance sheet is leveraged to finance growth. Debt-equity is high at 1.94, but the Current Ratio is a good 2.63. Its long-term debt is about $680 million, worth at least a few years' free cash flow.\n\n**Growth and the Future**\n\nCrocs is optimistic about its growth. It believes it can *quadruple* revenues by 2026 by focusing on its expanding digital sales, a strong marketing campaign, and deeper penetration of Asian markets. It believes the size of the casual footwear market is about $30 billion with no clear leaders and thus primed for a conquest.\n\nOwners will benefit from its buyback campaigns. Since 2018, buybacks have reduced shares in circulation by about 16%.\n\n**Valuation**\n\n* Growth Assumption: 15%\n* Intrinsic Value Per Share: $77\n\n# INTC\n\n**Summary of Operations**\n\nIntel is the world\u2019s largest producer of semiconductors and computer chips, offering a diversified product portfolio for different computing needs: personal, server, cloud, graphics, Internet of Things and so on.\n\nIn 2021, Intel reported $79 billion in net revenue and about $12 billion in free cash flow. Dell, Lenovo, and Hewlett-Packard account for 43% of their net revenue. By region, China accounts for 27%, and Singapore and the U.S. each about 18%.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nWith its healthy balance sheet and high cash generation, Intel sustains its own operations without taking on debt or needing to dilute shares. The company uses this cash to expand its manufacturing capabilities, in order to meet the demand of the current, global chip shortage and operate at a tremendous economy of scale.\n\nSince Gellsinger returned as CEO, he has stepped up commitments to capex and R&amp;D. This caused free cash flow in 2021 to be notably lower, as were the number of buybacks that had been increasing earnings per share the last five years. Gellsinger believes previous management neglected the underlying fundamentals of the company, hurting product quality and the brand. Recently, smaller semiconductor manufacturers have been capturing market share from under Intel\u2019s nose. Still, it retains the bulk of that market and has significant financial resources that competitors do not have, which Gellsinger intends to employ and turn the company around in the 2020s. $20 billion will be spent to develop the largest chip factory ever seen, right outside of Columbus, Ohio (among other projects).\n\n**Growth and the Future**\n\nIntel is a solid company, but the growth from these capital investments will take about five years to realize, which lower free cash flow for now. It\u2019s unclear how these will materialize into strong financial results. Gellsinger is right to focus on the fundamentals, and there is certainly demand to fill, but a big \u201cWhat if?\u201d remains. Can these intense expenditures produce growth for a company that is already quite large?\n\nThe weakening of the brand is the problem. AMD and Nvidia could continue to grow as well and could offset Intel\u2019s gains over the next decade. Where they lack scale, they have quality and are going to be first in line to satisfy chip demand.\n\nThe decline in buybacks is concerning too. While an accounting tactic, it did return value to shareholders.\n\n**Valuation**\n\n* Growth Assumptions: 5% first five years, 9% second five\n* Intrinsic Value Per Share: $40\n\n# KR\n\n**Summary of Operations**\n\nKroger is the second-largest grocer in the United States (also the owner of Harris Teeter). While mainly a retailer for other food producers, it does have its own store-brand lines for some of its products. It also owns many small grocers that operate under their local names.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nThe business is partly vertically integrated with its own store brands that are either produced by Kroger directly or by contracted third parties to Kroger\u2019s specifications. Otherwise, Kroger mainly sells goods provided by many different brands. Further vertical integration comes from fuel sales on site to make stops more convenient and integrated.\n\nOtherwise, the company steadily expands horizontally (about 3% compounded growth) by building or acquiring new stores (occasionally acquiring other grocers). Digital sales and data analysis have been lowering costs and enabled Kroger to use its scale to meet customer needs like never before, allowing them to maintain revenues in the face of COVID.\n\n**Growth and the Future**\n\nKroger is a profitable and stable company. Its size, customer appeal, and the perennial need to eat food give it a decent moat to grow steadily over time, but this is unlikely to be a multibagger. Its frequent share buybacks are where most of the returns will come for those who are long on the company, and since it is rarely exuberantly priced, the buybacks are unlikely to be wasted cash.\n\n**Valuation**\n\n* Growth Assumptions: 3%\n* Intrinsic Value Per Share: $25\n\n# THOR\n\n**Summary of Operations**\n\nThor Industries is the largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles (RVs) in the world, mainly through subsidiaries that they have acquired (many of which were in the last few years). It records the operations of its businesses under three segments; North American Motorized (21% of revenues), North American Towable (50%), and European (26%). \u201cOther\u201d operations account for the last 3%, and they mainly sell parts.\n\nDespite having so many subsidiaries, their approach to them is very hands-off, preferring to let the management work out their own relationships with suppliers, dealers, and employees. Subsidiaries even continue to compete amongst themselves. The nature and purpose of these acquisitions, therefore, is a curiosity.\n\nThe balance sheet is decent but somewhat leveraged. Operating cash flows have grown about 16% per year over the last decade. Much of this is continually reinvested into new PPE or further acquisitions.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nLike automobiles in general, RVs are a cyclical and seasonal industry. Factories are typically designed with the ability to increase and reduce productivity in response to demand with flexibility and without much incurred cost.\n\nNevertheless, the strategy of this company is the sum of the strategies of its subsidiaries. Thor is not stating any vision of leveraging its size and scale. This is strange, considering the concerns it\u2019s expressed in its risk factors (see annual report) about both suppliers and dealers continuing to consolidate, potentially putting Thor in a vice that could depress its margins.\n\nThe company seems like an investment mogul whose specialty is the RV industry. That\u2019s not bad per se, but returns will depend on the acquisitions being at low cost relative to the earning power of the asset.\n\nOne proactive thing I can see is that their website has a handy interface to match you with an RV product out of their many subsidiaries, based on a handy Q&amp;A feature. They also acquired a supplier called Airxcel in the last quarter, which they hope will meet supply needs, but it\u2019s unclear how much they will continue to acquire with such integration in mind, given their decentralized model.\n\n**Growth and the Future**\n\nMuch of the company\u2019s growth has therefore been enabled by horizontal acquisitions over the past decade. With the current market share that it has (over 40% in towable and motorized segments), there are not many more opportunities for consistent growth by this method.\n\nGrowth would then depend on an organic rise of the RV market. When you think it about it, there is no way this market should be anywhere close to the one for normal cars. RVs are more akin to luxury items and have narrower uses. While it is similar is in its cyclicality, but COVID had caused a recent and anticyclical spike in demand for RVs, as customers find these products are generally a safer way to travel or have vacations, which the recent regime of lockdowns and social distancing have made difficult or worrisome.\n\nIt\u2019s then a question of if this results in a paradigm shift, where these new customers continue to buy and use RVs well after the pandemic after developing a fondness for them. Otherwise, revenues will plateau or crash in the near future as quickly as they ballooned. Conservative growth assumptions are warranted.\n\n**Valuation**\n\n* Growth Assumptions: 7% first 5 years, 0% second 5\n* Intrinsic Value Per Share: $36",

        "selftext": "This was an incredible read and I definitely recommend the full book if you have the time. These were my favourite parts of the book. \n\n- Graham value investing is not about showboating or flouting ones intelligence.\n\n- Humans have a natural tendency to follow a herd of other humans. In other words, because humans do not have unlimited time and complete information, they tend to copy the behavior of other humans.\n\n- The lollapalooza tendency is the tendency to get extreme confluences of psychological tendencies acting in favor of a particular outcome.\n\n- It is not enough to be contrarian; you must also be sufficiently right in terms of the magnitude of the positive outcome that you outperform the markets.\n\n- Investor over-optimismand its evil twin, over-pessimismare what make Mr. Market bipolar. The good news for people who can keep their level of optimism at rational levels is that the unpredictable but inevitable gyrations between these two states create opportunities for Graham value investors.\n\n- Similarly, when you buy an asset, it should be the best investment of all the investments that are available to you anywhere.\n\n- For example, if stocks have recently dramatically fallen in a market crash, investors tend to be afraid to buy, even though it may be the very best time to buy.\n\n- People are also more likely to buy stocks if the markets have been rising in price significantly. This psychological tendency to misweigh what is easily recalled is a major reason why people are attracted to lotteries despite the dismal odds of winning, as they have seen other ordinary people win a lottery on the news. Lotteries promote this love by distributing pictures to the press of people holding oversized checks.\n\n- In the context of investing, it is both a fact of life and a shame that so many people spend more time picking out an appliance than picking an investment or investment fund.\n\n- This is the reciprocal of his (Munger\u2019s) investing advice: seek bets with a huge upside and a small downside (positive optionality).\n\n- Being a Graham value investor requires discipline. It is so much easier emotionally to follow the crowd than to be a contrarian.\n\n- The smarter you think you are, the more you may get into trouble doing things like trying to predict things that are not predictable. Due to overconfidence, a person with a high IQ can actually make more mistakes that someone whose IQ is 30 points lower.\n\n- Independent thinking, emotional stability, and a keen understanding of both human and institutional behavior are vital to long-term investment success. The best investors are those who have a temperament that is calm and rational.\n\n- Seth Klarman says \u201cUnsuccessful investors are dominated by emotion. Rather than responding coolly and rationally to market fluctuations, they respond emotionally with greed and fear.\u201c\n\n- Speculators correlate activity with productivity or success, whereas Graham value investors correlate disciplined inactivity with success.\n\n- Intrinsic value is what a businessman would pay for total control of the business with full due diligence and a big bank line. The biggest indicator to me is where the fully controlled position trades, not where the market trades it or where the stock trades relative to comparable [businesses].\n\n- Humans love stories because they cause them to suspend disbelief. Some of the biggest frauds in financial history, like Bernie Madoff and Ken Lay, were excellent storytellers. Stories cause people to suspend disbelief, and being in that state is harmful to any persons investing process.",

I included everything that I thought should satisfy a curious investor.\n\nEdit: I accidentally still had SOFI's information on my clipboard under VZ too, but I fixed it just now.  \nEdit 2: Revised future book value calculation, after talking with another user.\n\n# GM\n\n**Summary of Operations**\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) is one of the \u201cBig Three\u201d American car manufacturers, with global operations and business interests. 80% of its 2021 vehicles were sold in North America, accounting for 14% of the NA market (and 7.6% of the global market). Like other car makers, GM\u2019s business is seasonal and cyclical. Its units are sold to dealers who then sell them to individual drivers. Like its peers, it has been affected by the semiconductor shortage.\n\nIt owns some well known brands, such as Chevrolet, Buick, and GMC. GM Financial provides financing to customers that need it. It also enters into partnerships and joint ventures for new product lines that intrigue it. For example, its majority-owned subsidiary, Cruise Holdings, recently sold many preferred shares to Microsoft and Wal-Mart as part of its vision for autonomous vehicles (AVs).\n\n**Strategy**\n\nGM uses the cash generated by its brands and gas guzzlers to fund the development of new models, anticipating a future of electronic vehicles (EVs) and AVs. Compared to Ford, it is more optimistic about this future as a growth opportunity, but the annual report admits these cars will likely have smaller profit margins. Ford, meanwhile, seems prouder of Ford Credit and its ability to forge relationships with dealers, while GM Financial comes off as more of a footnote for GM.\n\n**Growth and the Future**\n\nWhile GM enters the future of AVs and EVs with a smile, it still faces a prospect of narrower margins in a competitive market. Can free cash flows climb for what is such a mature company and without a clear product advantage? The last decade featured significant growth, but this is nearly all a rebound from its crisis in the decade prior. GM has a right eye for the future, but high growth is difficult to assume.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nThis is a bit tricky as well, for much of the same reason as Ford. We can go by unadjusted free cash flows (I\u2019d say GM can do $6 billion per year) or book value because of the impact of GM Financial on the balance sheet.\n\n* Growth Assumptions: 0% first 5 years; 3% second 5.\n* **Intrinsic Value Per Share:** $33\n* Future Book Value Per Share: $37\n\n# SOFI\n\n**Summary of Operations**\n\nSoFi is a digital platform that provides financial services to its customers (which it calls \u201cmembers\u201d) with a mission of helping folks to achieve financial independence. Services include saving, lending, investing, banking, and financial advice. It primarily operates in the U.S. but has recently extended its reach to Hong Kong and Mexico through acquisitions and received a national bank charter just this year.\n\nLending services are their main source of revenue (student loans predominate). Gains from these loans are realized mostly through sale to another financial institution, rather than collection of interest. They maintain servicing rights for these loans after sale.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nThe company believes success will come from having a vertically integrated model of financial services that allows folks to have seamless movement among the different services on a 24/7 schedule (as opposed to business hours).\n\nBecause loans are their specialty, they use their data-driven model to offer flexible loan products to members, which gives them a competitive advantage. The customer accounts from their bank acquisition is intended to provide them with more capital to support this strong service (with less interest expense). Being unprofitable for the last three years, it\u2019s not surprising that they sought this advantage.\n\nWith recent acquisitions and expansions of their services, they hope they will be able to increase the earnings generated per members and not rely entirely and acquiring new members.\n\n**Growth and the Future**\n\nGrowth for an unprofitable company means becoming profitable. It\u2019s not altogether clear how they will stand out from all the other financial companies to attract customers and make a profit, but they are growing their \u201cmembership.\u201d Their golden goose is their student loans, and they acquired a bank to improve that function, with not much of a vision for banking in itself. Much of the same could said of their other financial services that they expanded over the last few years. They are still in the process of integrating it.\n\nSince the IPO, the stock has been tumbling. This doesn\u2019t seem like a badly run company, but it just may not succeed, and for now they like to talk about EBITDA more than I care to see. Peter Lynch says if you want to buy a turnaround stock, wait for the moment it actually turns around. Maybe that\u2019s how SOFI should be viewed.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nBecause this company has no earnings, I will not attempt a valuation.\n\n# VZ\n\n**Summary of Operations**\n\nVerizon is an American holding company whose subsidiaries primarily service telecommunications. These are broken into two segments: the Consumer Group and the Business Group. Consumer is focused on providing wireless services to individuals. It accounted for $95.3 billion in revenue (71% of 2021). Business offers more scope, to meet different commercial needs, which includes data, video and conferencing, corporate networking, Internet of Things, and so on. It accounted for $31 billion revenue for 2021.\n\nThe primary engine of cash is their monthly mobile phone wireless service, being one of the top three service providers in the United States (versus AT&amp;T and T-Mobile). In 2021, Verizon generated about $19 billion in free cash flow.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nVerizon believes the key to success lies in wireless service that is fast, reliable, and reasonably priced for the customer. To this end, they have focused heavily on the development of 5G technology and have built it into their infrastructure to allow for a seamless transition from their existing 4G assets without problems for the customer. This evolution was funded by taking on debt. Nevertheless, with their large moat of customers, a healthy operating margin, and positive cash flows, they have a pathway to paying this off.\n\n**Growth and the Future**\n\nVerizon believes it has sufficient means to meet rising demand for its services and expand its network. This company should be a steady compounder for owners. Shares of VZ have a decent yield (over 4% as I write this), and dividends frequently account for half of free cash flows. The company also has a history of increasing the dividend annually. This may prove easier to do after the debt is paid, and so the dividend should be main way to value an investment in the stock.\n\n**Valuation**\n\n* Growth Assumptions: 5% first 5 years, 10% second 5 years\n* **Intrinsic Value Per Share: $37**\n\nAgain, remember that this is for a 10% return. As a primary cell phone service provider who won\u2019t simply disappear, some might still see VZ as a hedge.",

        "selftext": "The russia war with ukraine is terrible, but the financial aspect is fascinating to me. All these companies are stopping their business there (although I think they will start back up as soon as it ends) and the value of russian stocks traded outside of russia have plummeted. With china backing russia, I think china stands to gain the most. China can buy up russian companies on the cheap since they are not subject to the sanctions. Chinese companies will move in to take over for all the foreign companies who pulled out (ie apple halting sales in russia and they are still going to need phones, so hello chinese phone makers who use android). I suspect russia will be very slow to go back to using non russia/non Chinese companies after this (ie why would they go back to visa/mastercard after the rug pull when they can\u2019t trust them as business partners). What are your thoughts?\n\nMy reason for posting this in value investing is that I wonder if my china benefitting thesis could provide a floor to the value of russian securities and thus make them good value plays.",

        "title": "Here's a stock you asked me to research: PLTR",
        "selftext": "Below is my analysis of Palantir.  While deeper analysis is possible, the goal is a concise elevator pitch, in line with what Peter Lynch recommends when making decisions to buy or sell. I included everything that *I thought* should satisfy a curious investor.\n\n## Summary of Operations\n\nPalantir provides software platforms to governmental and commercial enterprises in the U.S. and its Western allies.  These allow their customers to track, input, analyze, interact with, and make decisions based on their customer\u2019s data.  It is adaptable to the customer\u2019s needs, whether identifying positions of IEDs in war, understanding consumer purchasing habits, or following the movement of pieces that assemble a jumbo jet.  Palantir helps enterprises of many shapes and sizes achieve new levels of efficiency with data-driven decisions that would be difficult to perform independently, if at all.  While their platforms can be installed and operated within a company\u2019s own hardware or cloud system, Palantir also boasts a subscription-based cloud network that is readily accessible to any of its users.\n\nIn 2021, Palantir produced positive cash flows for the first time, with **$321 million in free cash flow**.  The company declared **$424 million in** ***adjusted*** **free cash flow** (after adding back cash paid for taxes on stock-based compensation).  I\u2019m not really sure how they justify this.\n\n## Strategy\n\nPalantir has three phases in building customer accounts: Acquire, Expand, and Scale.\n\n* **Acquire:** This is the opening phase.  Typically this involves a pilot program with the new account.  Palantir\u2019s staff is deeply involved and usually operates at a modest loss as it courts the customer and familiarizes it with software.  The customer enjoys minimal risk and obligations.  The goal is simple customer acquisition (think Thiel\u2019s PayPal paying people to join that platform).\n* **Expand:** After the Acquire phase, Palantir seeks to increase the sale of its software and service throughout that account, while also perhaps leveraging this relationship into the creation of new accounts with adjacent enterprises that have a relationship with the main account.  There is usually still a modest loss here but an increase in revenue.\n* **Scale:** The account reaches maximum saturation of software sales, increasing revenues further.  Costs decrease to cover simple maintenance and support, as the customer is usually very self-sufficient in use of software and has it customized to meet the data needs of their enterprise.  The account becomes a profitable relationship for Palantir at this point.\n\nThe length of these periods is not set in stone and can vary wildly based on the account.  Palantir expects that successful navigation through stages can take several months, maybe even a few years.\n\n## Growth and Future\n\nAs of 2021, Palantir is successfully cash flow positive.  This is good because relying on debt and the sale of equity is unsustainable.  Now it must learn to sustain its growth with is own cash.  One change that Palantir noted in its 2020 annual report was the expansion of sales staff to get their products to customers more quickly.  Positive cash flows and a 70% increase in total customers prove the wisdom of this investment.\n\nIn Palantir\u2019s own words, they have no obvious competitors with the kind of product they offer.  They claim their main competition is *the* *customer*, who may attempt to develop their own internal platforms.  It\u2019s possible that other tech giants could spawn a similar product line as what Palantir offers.  Given the lengthy process of courtship in maturing new accounts, Palantir may prove cyclical in its growth trends.\n\nAs technology continues to permeate society because more people are acquiring computers and because of the emerging Internet of Things, this means that there will be more data points that needs to structured, monitored, analyzed, and utilized for efficiency.  Palantir, therefore, has a growing market for which it will be a leading provider of a platform that performs this very work.\n\n## Valuation\n\n* Growth Assumptions: 15% first 5 years; 10% second 5\n* **Intrinsic Value Per Share: $2.65**",

If you don't want to read, YouTube video available here: [https://youtu.be/n2WFUDxHo7E](https://youtu.be/n2WFUDxHo7E)\n\n***Key Highlights from Filings:*** \n\n* Intel has been going through a pretty big shake up in the last year or so, this all started when Third Point (Activist Investors) put some pressure on the company\n* As a result of this the company has hired a new CEO, CPO, CGAO, CFO, and CCO - Basically they have turned over the top brass for the most part and started to implement a new strategy to grow the stagnated firm\n* IDM 2.0 is Pat's (CEO) strategy to invest in foundries to secure their supply chain and manufacturing while reducing costs. This will cost \\~$50Bn in capital investments over the next few years to build out 4 foundries (2 in Arizona, 2 in Ohio, along with updating 3 foundries in New Mexico, Malaysia, and Rio Rancho)\n* They plan to take their Mobileye division public this year, current estimates put the valuation at around $50bn. Intel will maintain a majority ownership of the company\n* The company is anticipating improved margins and revenue growth after these facilities are completed in the coming years, press release here: [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-highlights-2022-long-term-growth-strategy-investor-meeting.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-highlights-2022-long-term-growth-strategy-investor-meeting.html)\n* Intel appears to be in a good place and has a solid strategy in place with new management\n\n***Valuation:*** [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BEkF-WokspDTHF3JVgXmsJGuZ4ro8w-K/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=111740554424893797741&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BEkF-WokspDTHF3JVgXmsJGuZ4ro8w-K/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=111740554424893797741&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true)\n\n* You can download my model by using the link above and going to file -&gt; download. This will allow you to tweak any of my adjustments / check my work. Please let me know if something looks off in the model\n* I've applied management guidance for all years based off the above press release\n* This assumes moderate revenue growth with high capex over the coming years leading to a negative cash flow to be turned around a few years out when investments in the new foundries are complete and revenue will start to tick back up\n* WACC I've sensitized from 6-10%, I feel like 8% is probably pretty fair for a company that is as large and stable as Intel\n\n***Conclusion:***\n\n* I think Intel looks great and has a good new management team attached to them. They are in just about every sector that uses semi-conductors and with the imminent IPO of Mobileye I think this will unlock a lot more value for investors\n* We are at an exciting time in history where just about [everything](https://www.trypura.com/?gc_id=1650507019&amp;h_ad_id=358120948263&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAmpyRBhC-ARIsABs2EAoH2OUzYDFoZmQEsMZs7IAcFe2pHCGxy7AupjW24fp1YVbRfq8CfuIaArdzEALw_wcB) is being connected to the internet and Intel is in a great position to be a part of every aspect of this transition and be a leader in the space\n* I believe with fresh new leadership with a solid investments to secure production and control costs Intel has a bright future ahead of them\n\nThanks for making it this far! If you have any questions about my thought process or DCF feel free to let me know and I will try and answer.\n\nAs always I am not a professional investor, hold no position in Intel, and do these valuations for fun.

        "title": "Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letter Analysis, What I Found...",
        "selftext": "I recently stumbled across an article talking about Warren Buffett's most valuable contribution to value investors in the way that he thinks about investments. It's all entirely free and can be found in his annual shareholder letters, so I decided that I would go back and take a look at the earliest available one on [this website](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html) and do an analysis.\n\n# Some Context...\n\nThe 1977 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter is the first publicly available letter on Berkshire\u2019s website. 1977 was the first good year (for the stock price at least) that Berkshire had in eight years. According to [this post](https://boards.fool.com/berkshire-price-history-since-1965-15568119.aspx) Berkshire had an annualized -2.6% return from 1968 to 1976, this was despite a book value increase of 647% during the period. However, at the beginning of 1980 the share price had rocketed up to $290 (compared to $38 in 1976). At the time that this letter was written Buffett was running a company that was severely undervalued which the market refused to realize. This strange occurrence reminds me of the phrase \u201cthe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\u201d Eight years this investment stagnated, even when on a fundamental basis it was growing significantly.\n\n## Now Into The Letter\n\nBuffett opens by talking about what defines managerial competence. He says that simply increasing earnings year over year is not impressive by itself. As \u201ceven a totally dormant savings account will produce steadily rising interest earnings each year because of compounding.\u201d Instead he believes that \u201cReturn on Equity Capital\u201d otherwise known as Return on Equity (ROE) shows the competence of the managers as it demonstrates how efficiently they deploy their capital and resources.\n\nThis is something noteworthy worth exploring. Can looking for stocks with high ROE alone have good returns when compared to the overall market? According to this backtest conducted in [Backtesting-Based Value Investing](http://www.cek.ef.uni-lj.si/magister/smolic1653-B.pdf) the answer is a resounding yes!\n\nThe backtests conducted were from the period of 2001 to 2013 during which the broad market had a total return of 42.31%, one of the flattest decades since the 60s and 70s.\n\n([See image for reference](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e321358-a63d-4861-b581-d86d65722076_960x479.png))\n\nThat\u2019s a CAGR of only 2.75%! However, when we turn to the ROE portfolio, we see a massive outperformance with a 7.96% CAGR. The construction of this portfolio is simple, it consists of 20 of the highest five year average ROE stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with rebalances occurring annually. In fact, if we throw in in a low price to book ratio as well the returns jump to a 9.34% CAGR.\n\nNow granted, this is only a thirteen year period, but it is significant that this occurred during one of the worst performing decades in history.\n\nI'm also aware that value investing relies not just upon one factor like ROE, but I think that this is statistically significant because it shows the ties the market has to fundamental ratios when undergoing turbulent or flat periods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollowing this Warren talks about the specifics of some of the companies in his portfolio and how they have been performing. He then goes into the equity holdings of the insurance companies underneath Berkshire Hathaway [which look as follows](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02c3163c-99c3-491f-97d1-45a1f08ad60a_1220x618.png).\n\nNot surprisingly, Warren states that the criteria he uses to buy marketable securities hardly differs from the criteria used to acquire a company as a whole.\n\nHis criteria are as follows:\n\n1. The business needs to be one that can be understood by the investor.\n2. The company must have favorable long term prospects.\n3. The company must be operated by \u201chonest\u201d and \u201ccompetent\u201d people.\n4. The business must be purchasable at a \u201cvery attractive price.\u201d\n\nThe first criteria is one that is often overlooked. We think we know what a company \u201cdoes\u201d but that is not always the case. A great example of this is McDonald\u2019s. McDonald\u2019s on the surface appears to be a fast food company, but dig a little deeper and you will realize that they are actually in the real estate business and rather, *it is the franchisees who are in the fast food business.* [According to Wall Street Survivor](https://www.wallstreetsurvivor.com/mcdonalds-beyond-the-burger/) \u201cIn 2014, the McDonald\u2019s corporation made $27.4 billion in revenues, of which fully $9.2 billion came from franchised locations and the rest ($18.2 billion) was from company-operated restaurants\u201d and \u201cMcDonald\u2019s keeps close to 82% of all their franchise-generated revenue versus only 16% of its company-operated restaurant revenue.\u201d\n\nFavorable long term prospects are one of the harder things to quantify or understand, especially in an industry like tech where everything is constantly changing. For Buffett, this has meant sticking to to businesses that have proven long term prospects like Coca Cola, Apple, and Bank of America.\n\nThe third criteria of competent management is also highly important. One need look no further than Berkshire Hathaway itself. Much of its performance over the decades can be attributed to Warren Buffett\u2019s and Charlie Munger\u2019s investing prowess and being able to find good value companies. Prior to their acquisition of the company it was largely unknown.\n\nFinally the last criteria is where we see a large influence by Benjamin Graham. A \u201cvery attractive price\u201d usually constitutes a company that is trade very close to or possibly even below its book value. In today\u2019s market this is much harder to come by with the ease of credit and record high CAPE ratio. However, this should not be taken that value investing has fallen out of favor entirely, but simply that it is going through an unfavorable cycle. When the next market crash occurs many companies will return to more reasonable valuations.\n\n## Another Concept Worth Paying Attention To:\n\n*We select our marketable equity securities in much the same way we would evaluate a business for acquisition in its entirety. - Warren Buffett*\n\nThe key thing we should be concerned about is the mindset shift when we consider acquiring the company as a whole. It detaches our view of the stock market from \u201ca line that goes up or down that can make or cost me significant sums of money\u201d to investing in concrete businesses. \n\nLet\u2019s take a step back and look at private equity deals for a minute for comparison.\n\nIn the case of private equity with businesses valued under $5 million they trade hands at a 3-5x EBITDA multiple. In public markets EBITDA is far higher due to the size and stability of the company (closer to a 15x EBITDA). This valuation multiple is highly important to investors because if the multiple is too high then there will be no money to cover the debt service that is usually incurred in the leveraged buyout (up to 90% of the value is usually borrowed). On top of this, it also usually means that investors in private equity at these valuation multiples expect high returns (approximately a 25% CAGR according to [HBR\u2019s Guide to Buying a Small Business](https://books.google.com/books/about/HBR_Guide_to_Buying_a_Small_Business.html?id=Db6ltAEACAAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description)) in order to make it worth their while with low liquidity and higher risk.\n\nThe point in comparing our investments to the way that private equity runs theirs is that we *should* be chasing the same things. Even if our public investments don\u2019t pay their earnings out in dividends *we should act as though they did when choosing them.* The moment we stop doing this we fall prey to buying companies at poor valuations.\n\nI believe this is the heart of what Warren Buffett is trying to communicate here in regards to public equity markets.\n\nHopefully I was able to provide some value with this shareholder letter analysis. I'm curious what you have to think about it.",

Hunt Transport  Services, Inc. (\u201cJ.B. Hunt\u201d) for **approximately $86,900 in cash** subject to a customary post-closing working capital adjustment. The sale was completed on  *February 28, 2022.* Accordingly,  the operations of our logistical services segment, which consisted  entirely of the operations of Zenith, are presented in the accompanying  condensed consolidated statements of income as discontinued operations,  and the assets sold to and liabilities assumed by J.B. Hunt are  presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as  assets and liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale.\n\nIf we look at what the assets and liabilities carried on the books for this segment was, we find out what value these assets were being carried on the books at - including this sweet line:\n\n&gt;  In the second quarter of 2022, **we will recognize a substantial gain on this transaction** \n\n \n\n&gt;Total assets of discontinued operations held for sale  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$61,888 (2022)  $63,821 (2021)\n\nSo J.B.

No. For one, they are a national trucking line with lots more trucking specific infrastructure at their disposal. The synergy they can extract isn't a buzz word, it's real. Second, Bassett's books have almost certainly not accounted for the increase in value over time of the properties associated with their trucking subsidiary.\n\nA quick google let's us know when Bassett first began it's Zenith acquisition:\n\n&gt; Commenting on the deal, Robert H. Spilman, Jr., Bassett's President and CEO, said, \"Our initial investment in Zenith dates back to 1999.\n\nThe assets were purchased in part 23 years ago, and fully acquired in 2015. That's land and buildings with plenty of time to appreciate.\n\nWe could get a feel for this by looking into the 10-k and finding out what this subsidiary consisted of. Bassett laid it all out for anyone willing to read the details.\n\n&gt;Our customer solutions are provided through the following services:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-Network line haul freight (middle mile)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-Warehousing, distribution and inventory management  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At November 27, 2021, our shipping and delivery fleet consisted of the following:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Owned Leased Total**  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Tractors  \n&gt;  \n&gt;125       110       235        \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trailers  \n&gt;  \n&gt;318       360       678        \n&gt;  \n&gt;Local delivery trucks  \n&gt;  \n&gt;7       22       29        \n&gt;  \n&gt;We  ***own a central warehousing and national distribution hub located in Conover, North Carolina***, and we lease fourteen facilities in ten states  across the continental United States from which we operate regional  freight terminals and provide warehouse and distribution services.\n\nWe google and find out the distribution hub is on 20th street in Conover, NC. Another google we get the city website. Poke around, we find the zoning pages.\n\n[Catawba County assessor's portal](https://gis.catawbacountync.gov/parcel/)\n\n[One of bassett's acreages](https://gis.catawbacountync.gov/nomap/assessment_report.php?key=374119515108&amp;card=1) (a dozen or so different plats)\n\nSo there's a bunch of these. We could, if we cared to, go through them all and get reasonable guesses at the total property value involved, and adjust state equalized values to fair market. We can google and figure out what the average tractor and trailer is worth, as well as the average delivery truck, of which Bassett owned 125, 318, and 7, respectively.\n\nWe could add up all these assets and see if the book value is being seriously understated.\n\n***So what does this mean for Bassett as a book value opportunity?*** To me it indicates they probably have other long-lived assets which are perpetually undervalued \"on the books\". This is a company that makes furniture. That's lathes and woodworking equipment inside a factory, some warehouses, etc. Stuff that changes very little, requiring minimal CapEx to keep up to date, and with replacement values probably far above and beyond what they paid decades ago.\n\nNow I don't typically go through all this detail with a fine tooth comb. I do fast napkin math. But it's all there, out in the open, for the taking. I look for things so obvious they can't be denied.\n\nIn the 2020 panic, Bassett was selling under $10 per share from March to July. ***At it's 2020 low you could buy Bassett for 30 cents on the dollar of stated book, not considering hidden assets!*** Even if you'd not done your homework ahead of time, investors had 4 months to figure this out. This is a company with a rock solid balance sheet to begin with, and to riff Lincoln \"*5 score and 20 years*\" of operating history. Or *6 score*, or *a century plus a score*, if you prefer. A long damn time. Even today it sells at a fraction over stated Tangible Book (1.09), pays a solid dividend that's very easily covered, almost no debt outside of long-term lease obligations, with a number of special dividends paid when cash piled up.\n\nOn top of all this, checking the insider trading we'd see none other than the CEO &amp; Chairman, Spilman, Jr. was buying aggressively from Feb 2020 to October, with the bulk of it before July! When the CEO is buying, that's a good sign. When they buy 25% more stock than they owned previously in a 6 month period, really time to pay attention!\n\nThis was one of those cases where you get to buy well under the price floor of the assets alone, on top of an operating company with a long history of profitability and dividend payments, and practically no chance of going belly up.\n\nWhen the market finally figured it out, Bassett Furniture rebounded and shot up to almost $39 per share. For the Nostradamus who could have bought and sold perfectly, this represented an extraordinarily safe investment ***with a 7-bagger coupon attached in just over a year***.\n\nFor those willing to look, opportunities like this exist even today in \"overpriced\" markets. Just because the market might be high overall doesn't mean anything about a specific concern.\n\n**Something is always unpopular for no good reason.**\n\nDisclosure: I still own about half of the Bassett I picked up in 2020. My personal opinion it's probably a bit below fair value at $17.50, but nowhere near the screaming bargain it was.",

I think that Bill points to exactly why they sold and the unknowns that are now presented. I found it an interesting read and insightful as to why some investment companies offload shares outside of just general lower sentiment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nActual letter ([link to the post](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220420006196/en/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-Releases-Letter-to-Shareholders)):\n\n&gt; Dear Pershing Square Investor:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Today, we sold our investment in Netflix, which we purchased earlier this year. The loss on our investment reduced the Pershing Square Funds\u2019 year-to-date returns by four percentage points. Reflecting this loss, as of today\u2019s close, the Pershing Square Funds are down approximately two percent year-to-date.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While we have a high regard for Netflix\u2019s management and the remarkable company they have built, in light of the enormous operating leverage inherent in the company\u2019s business model, changes in the company\u2019s future subscriber growth can have an outsized impact on our estimate of intrinsic value. In our original analysis, we viewed this operating leverage favorably due to our long-term growth expectations for the company.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yesterday, in response to continued disappointing customer subscriber growth, Netflix announced that it would modify its subscription-only model to be more aggressive in going after non-paying customers, and to incorporate advertising, an approach that management estimates would take \u201cone to two years\u201d to implement. While we believe these business model changes are sensible, it is extremely difficult to predict their impact on the company\u2019s long-term subscriber growth, future revenues, operating margins, and capital intensity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We require a high degree of predictability in the businesses in which we invest due to the highly concentrated nature of our portfolio. While Netflix\u2019s business is fundamentally simple to understand, in light of recent events, we have lost confidence in our ability to predict the company\u2019s future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty. Based on management\u2019s track record, we would not be surprised to see Netflix continue to be a highly successful company and an excellent investment from its current market value. That said, we believe the dispersion of outcomes has widened to a sufficiently large extent that it is challenging for the company to meet our requirements for a core holding.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One of our learnings from past mistakes is to act promptly when we discover new information about an investment that is inconsistent with our original thesis. That is why we did so here.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We are in the midst of an opportunity rich environment for Pershing Square due to the dramatic shift in Federal Reserve policy, the highly inflationary environment, geopolitical uncertainty, and the resulting high degree of security price volatility. We therefore expect to find a good use for the Netflix proceeds. Please feel free to contact the investor relations team if you have any questions about the above. We are grateful for your support and long-term partnership.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sincerely,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;William A. Ackman",

Finally when asked, Buffett says nobody knows what inflation will be next year or 10 years from now\n* Best Question of the night imo - Why are you losing out to Union Pacific and Progressive? Greg dodges the question and Ajit basically says Progressive does everything better than Geico (Buffett jumps in and says Ajit has added more value to BRK than the entire market cap of Progressive)\n* Greg says they deal with BILLIONS of cybercrime attacks daily\n* Buffett says he doesn't want to say anything that will get Berkshire in trouble a few times through the day (Seemed really guarded in his responses)\n* They don't like passive ETF/fund managers pressuring them to change board/corporate structure\n* Buffett warns about how tribal people are acting.

        "selftext": "Modern accounting allows for a small trick that many companies take advantage of. As an investor, you should be wary of it.\n\nThe trick is to cleverly conceal stock-based compensation (SBC) within share repurchases.\n\nSome investors look at the statement of cash flows and calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF) by taking the Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) and subtracting CapEx. Unfortunately, SBC is treated as a non-cash expense and added back to Net Income in computing CFO, which means that the FCF number calculated is likely inflated.\n\nMore astute investors realize that there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. So, they treat SBC as a cash expense and ignore the line item that adds it back to Net Income in the statement of cash flows. While they are closer to the truth, they too are likely underestimating the impact of SBC.\n\nLet me explain with the example of Apple. Here\u2019s their [latest 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019321000105/aapl-20210925.htm).\n\nIf you look at their statement of cash flows, they have a SBC expense of [$7,906 million](https://imgur.com/a/Dtcf2ff) in the operating section.\n\nSo far so good. Now let\u2019s take a look at the [financing section](https://imgur.com/a/ZR4IN6G) (all numbers are in millions):\n\n* Proceeds from issuance of common stock = $1,105\n* Payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards = ($6,556) \\*\n* Repurchases of common stock = ($85,971)\n* Net cash flow related to common stock transactions = ($91,422)\n\n*\\* negative sign represents cash outflow*\n\n You can see the shares outstanding in the [balance sheet](https://imgur.com/a/uzvFqwb) (all numbers are in thousands):\n\n* Shares outstanding at the end of fiscal 2021 = 16,426,786\n* Shares outstanding at the end of fiscal 2020 = 16,976,763\n* Net change in shares = 549,977\n\nSo Apple used $91.4 billion to repurchase 550 million shares. This works out to $166 per share. But AAPL shares never traded as high as $166 in fiscal 2021 (Oct-2020 to Sep-2021). Something\u2019s fishy here.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the notes to the financial statements. Specifically [Note 8](https://imgur.com/a/Q6qxSri). There you go. The company repurchased not 550 but 656 million shares. But it also issued 106 million shares to employees.\n\nSo, of the $91 billion cash used in common stock transactions, only $76.6 billion (550/656 * 91) was truly used for repurchase. The other $14.8 billion was actually used for SBC (distributed as shares instead of dollars).\n\nThis means that the actual SBC of $14.8 billion is nearly double the reported figure of $7.9 billion!\n\nWhere does this $6.9 billion differential show up? Not on the balance sheet, the income statement, or the statement of cash flows. It shows up in the lower share count, or a lack of it. There\u2019s your sleight of hand.\n\nHere\u2019s a [summarized view](https://imgur.com/a/Y8wL5le) of this gimmick. This isn't to pick on Apple. A lot of companies do this and it may be a natural consequence of the compensation policies. The lesson for us investors is that we should be skeptical of the reported SBC and repurchase numbers and adjust our cash flow expectations accordingly. Cheers!",

        "title": "Shopify company analysis and valuation - 80% down and still expensive? ($SHOP)",
        "selftext": "Shopify had a crazy stock-price movement in the last 2 years, went from roughly $350 prior to the pandemic, to almost $1,800 (almost 5x) at its peak, and is now down to $364 (80% down).\n\nThe goal of this post is to share my fundamental analysis and valuation of this highly volatile company. Feel free to provide your feedback and disagree with me :)\n\nAt the peak, the market cap was over $220b, let's keep that number in mind. Today, it's around $46b. Let's get started!\n\n Link to the video for those who prefer to watch: [https://youtu.be/gMji2hQCg1I](https://youtu.be/gMji2hQCg1I) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is Shopify?**\n\nIn one sentence, it is an eCommerce website builder that takes care of the infrastructure and provides additional services/solutions (payment processing, marketing, analytics, inventory &amp; fulfillment, etc.). It allows setting up and operating a business online easier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How does Shopify make money?**\n\nThe revenue is split into two groups:\n\n1. Subscription revenue - This is self-explanatory, and refers to the monthly recurring revenue that Shopify gets from the individuals/businesses that use their platform. This stream of revenue doesn't depend on the success of the users. Regardless if a company sells 1 product or a million, the subscription revenue is fixed. In my view, this is the less-risky stream as they'd only lose customers if they switch to another platform (not that likely) or a business goes bankrupt. Historically, this stream grew 50% year-over-year, now almost $1.4b for the last twelve months (ending Q1/2022). This is also a high-margin business, with a gross margin of 80%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Merchant solutions - This is the segment that takes all of the other revenue and is highly dependent on the success of the individuals and businesses that use the platform. Payment processing fees, currency conversion, referrals, advertising, etc, all of that is included here. If there's a slowdown in the economy and the eCommerce business decreases, this stream of Shopify would be harmed. In the last years, it grew roughly 75% year-over-year to almost $3.5b in the last twelve months. The gross margin in this segment is lower (43%).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe overall gross margin has been decreasing and if we only look at that in isolation, the conclusion would be that something bad is going on and Shopify cannot keep its margins at the same level. This is not correct. The reason for the margin decline is only due to the fact that the lower-margin revenue stream (Merchant solutions) is growing faster than the higher-margin revenue stream (Subscription-based). Hence, the gross margin naturally moves closer to the stream that contributes more.\n\nSo, the total revenue is close to $5b. If we put this next to the market cap at its peak of $220b, it seems quite unreasonable for anyone to pay such a huge premium. Yes, the company has been growing at high rates, but the growth cannot continue at that pace forever. The moment the growth declines, that's where the problems start and a correction comes in, so it's always wise to incorporate this growth decline in the model and not assume growth of 50-60% for a very long period of time.\n\nThe overall gross margin is at 53% for the last 12 months and it is expected to drop even further. Let's keep it simple and assume that it will decrease to 50%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Operating expenses**\n\nWith the remaining 50%, Shopify needs to cover 3 main expenses to get to the operating result.\n\n1. Sales &amp; marketing - Decreased from 34% of revenue (2017) to 21% in LTM.\n\n2. R&amp;D - Remains stable at around 20% of revenue in the last 5 years\n\n3. G&amp;A - Remains stable at around 10% of revenue in the last 5 years\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy subtracting these 3 costs, we get to an operating profit of 1%. So, a company with revenue below $5b and no operating profit, was selling for $220b. That sound quite irrational. Of course, there are a couple of other factors to consider.\n\nEvery growth company puts as much effort as possible into growing quickly. For Shopify, that's mainly in Sales &amp; Marketing and R&amp;D. The more potential customers they can reach, the faster they can grow. The more they can innovate, the more services they can provide. However, as the growth slows down, these costs as % of revenue decrease. The marketing won't yield the same returns as before, simply because the # of potential customers decreases. All of this will lead to margin expansion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Balance sheet**\n\nThere are a couple of main points to mention:\n\n1. Shopify is a capital-light business that doesn't need to invest in tangible assets in significant amounts.\n\n2. They have a strong cash position ($7.2b in cash &amp; short term investments + $2.9b in long-term investments)\n\n3. The debt is at a very low level, roughly $1.2b (insignificant compared to their $10b cash/investments). It could be argued that they didn't use the low-interest rates to increase their financial leverage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, Shopify announced the acquisition of Deliverr for $2.1b, a company that will add value in their process of inventory inbounding and distribution. The aim is to offer delivery to the customer within 2 days of ordering (Competitive with Amazon Prime). This is not yet paid, so needs to be deducted when valuing Shopify as a company)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DCF model**\n\nKey assumptions:\n\n1. Revenue growth: 25% for the next 5 years, then slowly decrease to the risk-free rate of almost 3%.\n\n2. Operating profit: Slowly improve to 25% (Basically, the 3 types of expenses mentioned above, combined, should decrease to 25% of revenue over the next 10 years)\n\n3. Discount rate - 11.7% (Based on WACC)\n\nOutcome: **Value per share - $276/share (current market price - $364)**\n\nMy assumptions are based on what I think Shopify can deliver with high probability. Could be I be wrong? Absolutely!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What if I'm wrong?**\n\nBased on my assumptions, the revenue will grow by 426% in 10 years and the operating margin is estimated at 25%. However, I could be significantly wrong. Therefore, the table below provides a valuation of the company based on assumptions different than mine related to the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Revenue / Op. margin|20%|25%|30%|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|300% ($19.0b)|$190.1|$229.3|$269.1|\n|426% ($24.4b)|$226.8|$275.8|$326.4|\n|1000% ($51.0b)|$400.3|$500.5|$601.0|\n|3350% (159.9b)|$1,089.9|$1,388.4|$1,687.0|\n\nBased on your assumptions about the revenue growth and margin expansion of Shopify, you can decide whether the company is expensive or not at this price.\n\nThe last row is only for illustration of how irrational the market was in the last year when the price went up to almost $1800. Basically, to justify that valuation, the company would need to grow the revenue by around 50% every year for the next decade and at the same time improve its operating margin to 30%. So, starting with the gross profit being around 50%, the Sales &amp; Marketing, R&amp;D, and G&amp;A together, should be 20% of sales.\n\nFeel free to add your insights into Shopify and add value to the analysis.

        "selftext": "The OTLY stock chart is one you don\u2019t see every day. It's down \\~80% since the IPO in almost a straight line. The fundamentals, in their own way, are even more amazing.\n\nOatly went public little over a year ago, raising over $1 billion in the process. Yet the company *absolutely* needs to raise a significant amount of capital in the next 12 months.\n\nOatly finished Q1 with $411 million in cash. Guidance suggests Q2-Q4 capex of $347-$447 million. Management ostensibly could pull back, but commentary surrounding Q1 results and the company\u2019s strong belief in up-and-to-the-right demand suggests it won\u2019t, at least not immediately. Operating losses \u2014 Q1 Adjusted EBITDA was negative $71 million \u2014 should wipe out the remainder of the cash balance.\n\nThat means Oatly will need to utilize its revolver, with about $475 million in capacity. But one of the covenants of that revolver requires positive EBITDA by Q2 2023 \u2014 unlikely, to say the least, given EBITDA margins in Q1 were negative 43%.\n\nIf, however, Oatly can raise $400 million by the end of the year, that covenant gets pushed out four quarters. Oatly needs that cushion \u2014 and it probably needs that cash. On the Q1 call last month, even management said \u201cwe have sufficient liquidity to fund our business through 2022.\u201d In other words, dilution is coming.\n\nAll that said, if you look past, you know, the actual fundamentals of the stock, the business does look somewhat intriguing here. It\u2019s easy to dismiss oat milk as a fad, or at least a highly commoditized product, but Oatly\u2019s top-line growth has been impressive. Revenue rose 53% in 2021 after more than doubling the year before; Oatly is guiding for 37-43% growth this year. Both China and the Americas (Europe was more than half of sales last year) have significant room for further penetration going forward.\n\nThe company\u2019s plan to bring more manufacturing in-house will cost cash \u2014 but it should boost margins as well. If Oatly can get to 2025/2026, there\u2019s a world in which turns into a reasonably stable, profitable, if niche player in the industry.\n\nThere\u2019s also the takeout possibility. Gluten-free leader Boulder Brands was bought by Pinnacle Foods back in 2015 for almost 2x revenue \u2014 and there seemed clear risk at the time that gluten-free was a fad in a way that oatmilk probably isn\u2019t.\n\nThe problem is that \u2014 almost incredibly given post-IPO performance \u2014 OTLY *still* trades at \\~2.5x revenue, assuming modest net debt year-end and revenue toward the low end of the company\u2019s outlook. And that 2.5x multiple is based on the current share count; assume \\~20% dilution is coming (say, Oatly raising $550M against the current market cap of \\~$2.2B) and the multiple gets up to \\~3x.\n\nSo many of these stocks that are down 80%-plus simply don\u2019t seem to have compelling fundamentals. OTLY is no exception. Indeed, had the company gone public this year, one can imagine a relatively niche IPO, in which Oatly raised something like $300 million at a $1.5 billion valuation and analysts called it \u201can undercovered growth story\u201d.\n\nPerhaps management needs to start running that kind of company, instead of serving the \u201cgrowth at any cost\u201d mentality that dominated the market until last year.\n\n## Beyond Meat (BYND)\n\nOatly has some amazing fundamentals, but Beyond Meat\u2019s are laughable. Not in the sense that they\u2019re laughably bad (well, that too) but in the sense that a fundamental-driven investor should literally laugh out loud at some of the numbers.\n\nLet\u2019s start here. BYND stock is down 83% over the past year \u2014 and its short interest still is 40% of the float. If we used those figures to create a version of the SaaS Rule of 40 (which is not a terrible idea in this market), perhaps the S\u2014Co Rule of 40, BYND would come in at a sterling 123.\n\nBut it\u2019s the first quarter numbers that really tickle the funny bone. Beyond Meat \u2014 which makes hamburgers out of peas \u2014 posted a gross margin of 0.2%. Its gross margin is more properly measured *in basis points*. Its EBITDA loss was 72% of revenue (a percentage not more properly measured in basis points). Yes, the company is growing its sales \u2014 but at a 1.2% clip year-over-year.\n\nAny good investor knows to look beyond the headline fundamentals for a single quarter. But it\u2019s not like a closer look suggests those headline figures were notably skewed. Launch costs for Beyond Meat Jerky hit gross margins by 940 bps \u2014 but that still suggests gross margins below 10%. That aside, gross margin still fell by more than 20 percentage points year-over-year, with the company citing \u201cincreased trade discounts\u201d and \u201clist price reductions\u201d in Europe.\n\nIn other words, Beyond Meat is cutting prices. Meanwhile, like everyone else, it\u2019s facing higher costs. The problem is that even fixing those costs doesn\u2019t help much: Beyond Meat\u2019s gross margins fell 700 bps-plus last year. Again, this is not a single-quarter problem. Even in 2020, with a net pandemic tailwind, the company only generated $12 million in Adjusted EBITDA (with $27 million in stock-based comp). The loss on the same basis last year was $112 million.\n\nBeyond Meat\u2019s $1 billion in convertible debt (thankfully at a 0% coupon) matures in 2027 \u2014 and is yielding more than 20%. Beyond Meat\u2019s equity still has a valuation of roughly $1.5 billion. Insert your own joke here, and keep an eye out for any opportunity to join the horde of traders shorting this stock.\n\n[Link to original post](https://www.overlookedalpha.com/p/research-notes-consumer-upstarts?s=w).",

This number is currently at 150% compared to 120% for Japan, 100% UK and only around 60% for Eurozone. The gap has narrowed over the last few months (US was at 200%), but remains well above historical averages. USD also appreciated by 20% against most other currencies during this period making other markets cheaper.\n\nNow there are good reasons why these markets have a lower valuation. Namely slower growth and demographics. But at the same time I think it more than compensates by being cheaper. \n\nConsider the Eurozone which is almost 3x cheaper. Structural issues, high debt, Russia conflict. But the countries are working on structural improvements and integration. With the UK gone it will be much easier. Japan has the demographics issue and high debt too. However, yen is currently at a 24 year low, there is no inflation and a massive structural opportunity for higher labour participation and foreign investment. These are areas that the government is working on.\n\nLet's go a bit further and consider some emerging markets. My two favourites are Poland and Indonesia. \n\nPoland is roughly the size of Spain in terms of population and size, and has a third of its debt. It has one of the best growth prospects in the EU. Excellent geographic location close to the centre. A bridge between east and west. Will massively benefit from the coming integration of Ukraine. However, the total market cap of all public companies there is $180bn. That is roughly the market cap of Adobe. Spain in comparison has a market cap of $800bn.\n\nIndonesia has a market cap of around $400bn which is the size of Nvidia and smaller than Tesla. This is a country with a population almost the same size as the US. Has a huge young working age population that will continue to grow over the next decade fuelling consumption. The country is growing at 5-6% a year. It is arguably becoming one of the next large, low-cost manufacturing centres with many companies abandoning China. \n\nTLDR: US is expensive and its dominance may not last forever.

        "title": "Maybe safe-haven stocks aren\u2019t so safe after all?",
        "selftext": " With all this volatility, I\u2019m hearing a lot of people advise that investors put their money in \u201csafe-haven\u201d stocks. Common safe-havens I hear people advise are companies like JNJ, PG, WMT, BMY, COST, and KO.\n\nAs a value investor, I decided to analyze these stocks to see if they are selling at fair or discounted value. These stocks typically make up a large portion of most value ETFs. But are they truly \u201cvalue\u201d stocks in the sense that they are selling below their intrinsic value?\n\nHere is what I found:\n\n**Johnson &amp; Johnson**\n\nJNJ is a great company. It has a great ROE, impressive profit margins, low debt, fairly consistent earnings growth over the past 10 years and a solid brand.\n\nBut is it selling for fair value? Not even close. Assuming a 9% earnings CAGR (a generous assumption considering its growth rate for the past 5 years is 5.7% and analysts are estimating a 5% growth rate over the next 5 years), JNJ\u2019s intrinsic value is only $94/share. It is currently selling at $177. JNJ would need to maintain a 19% earnings growth rate in order to justify its current price.\n\n**Procter &amp; Gamble**\n\nPG is another great company. It has all the same strengths as JNJ (High ROE, profit margins, low debt, consistent earnings and many strong brands). There are a few red flags, though. First, insiders are selling the stock at a rapid rate and its debt level is higher than JNJ. This is especially concerning because PG has significantly less cash to cover its debt. \n\nDespite these red flags, PG is worth well over $160billion. The only problem: its current market cap is $345billion. To justify its current, high price, PG would need to maintain a 21% growth rate, which is very unlikely considering its past growth rate of 9.5%.\n\nProcter &amp; Gamble may be viewed as a safe haven by many investors, but is not a good value.\n\n**Walmart**\n\nWMT is a behemoth. But it is still very overpriced. By analyzing its fundamental value, including its earnings, past growth rate, expected future growth rate, profit margins, ROE and debt levels, I calculated Walmart\u2019s intrinsic value to be $52/share. It is selling for $122. \n\n**Bristol-Myers Squibb**\n\nBMY is, perhaps, the most overpriced stock on this list. I calculate its value at around $22/share. It is currently selling for $77. I was surprised to see that most pharmaceutical companies are selling at a massive premium, including LLY, ABBV, BIO, BIIB, GILD, MRK, PFE and WST. Pharmaceuticals do not look like good hunting grounds for value investors right now.\n\n**Costco**\n\nI love Costco. I spend hundreds of dollars there every month and have tremendous brand loyalty. But is Costco selling at a reasonable price? No.\n\nI calculate the value of COST to be around $130billion. It has a market cap of $212billion. I wouldn\u2019t touch Costco unless it drops 40-50%.\n\n**Coca-Cola**\n\nKO will always be part of value investment history because of Warren Buffett\u2019s massive investment in the company. It was certainly a value stock in 1988. But is it a value stock now?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like it. Despite its stellar ROE and profit margins, it is growing too slowly to justify its high PE of 26. It looks like it is selling at close to double its intrinsic value.\n\nI also feel concerned about the level of insider selling on the stock. It was a legendary value buy in 1988, but it doesn\u2019t look like a good value in 2022.\n\n**VALUE OPTIONS**\n\nThere are some good value stocks out there.\n\nFAANG- After the recent dip, all FAANG stocks look fairly priced to me. META, NFLX and AAPL look underpriced.\n\nINTC- I calculate INTC\u2019s intrinsic value to be around $100/share. It is selling for $38. The semiconductor space looks undervalued as a whole, so value investors should take a closer look here. \n\nFinancials look like a great value. JPM, C, MA, DFS, TROW all look like good values. Plus, the tailwind of higher rates could help boost earnings even further.\n\nAutos- With the exception of TSLA, most auto stocks look underpriced. TM, HMC and F are a few of my favorites. I also like auto dealer stocks like ABG and CRMT.\n\nRetail- WMT and COST are both overpriced, but there is good value in the retail space. TGT is selling at a very reasonable price and BBY looks like it is selling at a 50% discount. There are also awesome values in the small-cap retail space like CONN, ASO, KIRK, BGFV and TCS.\n\n**I'd love to hear feedback from anyone. Especially if you think my analysis is wrong. Thanks in advance!**",

        "title": "I built a tool to help retail investors invest like Warren Buffett. Imagine a trading app but you'll see Owner's earnings instead of stock prices.",
        "selftext": "Hey everyone I built a free website to help retail investors invest like Warren Buffett: in great companies for a long time. It's called [Moat](https://themoatapp.com) and unlike a conventional trading app, on Moat, you won't see stock prices which makes you treat stocks like lottery tickets. Instead, you'll see the [Owner's earnings](https://stablebread.com/how-to-calculate-and-analyze-warren-buffetts-owners-earnings/) of the companies and shares you own. By focusing on earnings, **Moat helps you Own businesses, not trade stocks.**\n\n**What does Moat do?**\n\nMoat puts you in the position of a value investor and helps you own businesses, instead of stocks.\n\nValue investing at its core is really about **owning companies and the earnings they generate**. It's understandably difficult to feel like you own the company when you buy its shares. We're so detached from its day-to-day operations and we are always looking at its stock price which is why we often treat stocks like lottery tickets.\n\nHowever, owning a share of a company is owning a share of the earnings they generate each quarter. Moat puts you in the position of a business owner, not a trader.\n\n**Why did I make Moat?**\n\nI made Moat because like many retail investors I used to conflate investing with trading. I would buy a stock hoping to sell it for more than what I paid for (to someone more \"foolish\" than me). On top of that, I would react and panic when stock prices went up or down which made me trade stocks like lottery tickets instead of investing in and owning wonderful companies that can earn lots of money. Bottom line, it's really difficult to own businesses that can enable you to compound your wealth when you look at stock prices.\n\nMany retail investors, especially newer ones, go, will go, or have gone through this. Value investing (for the long run) is against human nature and therefore inherently difficult for us to do. I built Moat so retail investors would be able to **invest like a value investor intuitively**.\n\n**How does Moat help you invest like Warren Buffett?**\n\nOn Moat, you won't see stock prices or your day-to-day portfolio value like you would on a conventional trading app.\n\nInstead, you will see the Owner's earnings of the companies and shares you own/have owned. Each day you own a company, you're entitled to receive a day's worth of their quarterly earnings.\n\nIn doing so, Moat inadvertently compels you to invest like a value investor:\n\n1. Invest in companies with wide moats that can generate lots of money for a long time\n2. Buy companies when their stocks are cheap compared to their earnings\n3. Stay invested and hold on to companies for as long as they continue to make lots of money instead of trading them.\n\nUltimately the goal of a value investor is to invest in companies that can one day **earn more** than what they initially invested. This is exactly what Warren Buffett does: buy wonderful companies at attractive prices, and collect the earnings they generate \u2013 again and again. Moat doesn't just help you stop trading, it compels you to become an excellent business owner/value investor like Warren Buffett.\n\nI really hope you guys find value in Moat and that it contributes to a larger discussion of the future of retail investing and value investing and how they can come together.\n\nFor those who are curious, this is a much more powerful and user-friendly improvement of a [spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/ph6vww/a_spreadsheet_that_will_automatically_make_you/) I posted a few months back.\n\n**Updates:**\n\n7/4: there was a bug preventing people from signing up properly. It has since been fixed. Give it another shot!\n\n7/4: I came across a pretty nasty bug that messed up entering your past investments. I've fixed it since but I'm going to make a simple bug report form soon. In the meantime, if you come across a bug let me know in the comments.",

        "title": "Fundamentals Guide for Beginners Step by Step",
        "selftext": "Re-posting and doing a sticky of my guide here because the last guide links for the stickies post are now dead. Copied from here: https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kheec2/the_ultimate_fundamentals_guide_on_what_you_need/\n\nThis is going to be the ultimate guide on ***what*** you should learn first starting from knowing absolutely nothing about investing to becoming an investor who can beat the market indexes. It doesn't matter if you invest in penny stocks or blue chips. The principles are all the same.\n\nThis is an opinionated guide. If you just want a resource unopinionated guide then check out this github:\n\n[https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit](https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit)\n\nI will update it constantly in the future.\n\n# Prerequisites\n\n\\- There are no capital requirements to investing. In fact you should start learning as soon as possible because it takes time to become proficient at investing.\n\n\\- This guide is only for fundamentals as I specialize in fundamentals and not day trading, technical charting, cryptocurrencies or forex trading.\n\n\\- This guide is tailored towards people who want to individually pick stocks, if you solely do ETF's or index investing this guide is still useful to you but not aimed at you.\n\n\\- Investing should be done with disposable income. NOT with income you need such as rent money.\n\n\\- If you aren't willing to put in the time and effort that investing requires to beat the market indexes then you should stick to passive investing and just buy an index fund and forget about it for 20 years. This requires 0 effort but you will never beat 8% a year on average and you because you lack experience you may panic and sell at times when you shouldn't.\n\n# 1. Getting Started\n\nTo start off I would recommend watching this overview video, it quickly goes over the main stuff by legend investor Bill Ackman:\n\n[Bill Ackman: Everything You Need to Know About Stocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEDIj9JBTC8)\n\nThen you should start reading, lots of reading and no big amounts of investing. You have to read books from other fundamental investors to have an idea of how they did it and the decades of accumulated experience of investing they have poured into that book. It's important to read the right books from authors who have a track record of beating the market, not just anybody. I have ordered this list in terms of ease of reading for newbie investors as well as priority:\n\n1. [Peter Lynch - One Up On Wall Street](https://www.amazon.co.uk/One-Up-Wall-Street-Fireside/dp/0743200403)\n2. [Peter Lynch - Beating the Street](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beating-Street-Peter-Lynch/dp/0671891634)\n3. [Joel Greenblatt - The Little Book That Beats the Market](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Beats-Market-Books-Profits-ebook/dp/B000YIUWFQ)\n\nThese 3 are all easy books for a beginner to get their feet wet and start off with some solid fundamentals. The harder books will come later.\n\n# 2. Reading Financial Statements\n\nInvesting is all about reading financial statements and understanding how to read them such as the 10-k, 10-Q etc. Pick any company, it doesn't matter which one but I recommend that you pick a simple company that you already use and know.\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n* [Session 2: The Income Statement (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8wKr1QDSwg)\n\n**Statement of Cash Flows**\n\n* [Session 4: The Statement of Cash Flows (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XobT12fvkXc&amp;t=1s)\n\n**The Balance Sheet**\n\n* [The Balance Sheet (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSuc2HHQpxc&amp;t=1s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Official RNS Reporting Sites**\n\nCompanies are required to file official reports with their countries regulator, in the U.S this is the SEC (apart from small companies that trade Over The Counter).A list of the most popular official sites, you can search for your company on here:\n\n\\- [SEC - United States Listed Stocks](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)\n\n\\- [OTC - United States OTC (Penny) stocks](https://www.otcmarkets.com/)\n\n\\- [LSE - UK Stocks](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/)\n\n\\- [ASX - Australian Stocks](https://www2.asx.com.au/)\n\n\\- [NZX - New Zealand Stocks](https://www.nzx.com/)\n\n\\- [TSX - Canadian Stocks](https://www.tsx.com/)\n\n\\- [CSE - Canadian Alternative Stocks](https://www.thecse.com/)\n\n\\- [EURONEXT - France, Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Norway, Alt UK](https://www.euronext.com/en)\n\n\\- [GPW - Polish Stocks](https://www.gpw.pl/en-home)\n\n\\- [BOERSE FRANKFURT - German Stocks](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en)\n\nFilings dump: [https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit#filings](https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit#filings)\n\nIt makes no sense to limit yourself to investing in one country only. A lot of bargains lay in other countries and you should expand your horizons to them and not just U.S stocks on Robinhood. So I added international links above too.\n\nA lot of the above sites also have email signups so you can be notified **instantly** when a companies publish a new report.\n\n# 3. Intrinsic Valuations\n\nThe most important part of this section in my opinion. If you understand how to intrinsically value a company then you understand when to buy and when to sell a company based on it's real value.\n\nThese differ from relative valuations such as the ratio's (PEG, PE etc) because here we are trying to find the intrinsic value to a company and NOT the relative value compared to it's peers. This is an important difference, for example in the 2001 dot com bubble you could have valued an insanely overvalued internet stock with a relative ratio such as Price-Operating-Cash-Flow and you may have found it to be better than it's peers. Just because it's better relatively than it's peers in it's industry does not mean a company is fair value.\n\n**Discounted Cash Flows Models**\n\nThe reason a lot of people do not like DCF's is because:\n\n1. They do not understand how to do them properly.\n2. The resources online are absolutely terrible for DCF's, most use CAPM (in my opinion, a completely flawed way to calculate your WACC).\n3. The templates are confusing.\n\nI felt the same way until I watched Aswath Damoradan's course on corporate finance.\n\nHere's the short course with 15 min long videos each:\n\n[Short Course on Valuation (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znmQ7oMiQrM&amp;list=PLUkh9m2BorqnKWu0g5ZUps_CbQ-JGtbI9)\n\nHowever I highly recommend you do the entire university course (for free) because it's invaluable to understanding how to intrinsically value companies:\n\n[2019 Full Undergraduate Valuation Course (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IxSvyBEK7s&amp;list=PLUkh9m2Borqn0rW96St_MJchWcjbdfWxT)\n\n[2019 Full MBA Valuation Course (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMw4AuMRlE&amp;list=PLUkh9m2Borqkr0lxe9WjH7cDBi4ZnZPOx)\n\nThere is a lot of cross-over between the above two playlists so once you do one course you can cherry pick videos from the other course.\n\nHere are some resources on how to do your own DCF's:\n\n[Covid DCF Template Excel Spreadsheet (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9GfXJ-IrSA&amp;list=PLUkh9m2Borqnk6tJUpGzN4RcDUBAjovqN&amp;index=4)\n\n[NYU - All Valuation Spreadsheets (Free)](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/)\n\nThe reason why I like these DCF models are because they are easy to use (Aswath explains how to use the excel template it in his video) and it does not use the flawed CAPM model for calculating the WACC.\n\n**Dividend Discount Models**\n\nAn alternative way of getting the intrinsic value of a company. I do these very rarely so I'm no expert on them. I hope to up date this section in the future with more details.\n\n* [Aswath Damoradan - Ch 14: Dividend Discount Models](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/valn2ed/ch14.pdf)\n\n# 4. Relative Valuation Ratio's &amp; Technical Terms\n\nThere are **a ton** of financial terms and ratio's to learn such as PE, PEG, ROIC etc. The way to go about this is to learn these ratio's as you go when you encounter them in a book or your valuation and not just all at once. Investopedia usually has good explanations and videos of every term.\n\n\\- [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/)\n\nThe most important ratio's and relative valuations in my opinion are:\n\n\\- [Revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp)\n\n\\- [Operating Margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingmargin.asp)\n\n\\- [Operating Income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp)\n\n\\- [ROIC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestmentcapital.asp)\n\n\\- [WACC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) (not the CAPM Version)\n\n\\- [Price-to-operating Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-cash-flowratio.asp#:~:text=The%20price%2Dto%2Dcash%20flow%20(P%2FCF),and%20amortization%20to%20net%20income)\n\n\\- [Price-to-free Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetofreecashflow.asp)\n\n\\- [Price-to-owner-earnings](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/p2Owner_Earnings/PLA/Price-to-Owner-Earnings/)\n\n\\- [Debt-to-Equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp)\n\n\\- [Interest Coverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestcoverageratio.asp)\n\n\\- [PEG](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp)\n\nThe most useless financial metric by far that way too many people use is the [PE ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp), it is easily manipulated by accounting shenanigans, fluctuations in short term reporting and reinvesting companies such as Amazon. The PEG ratio also suffers from this but is better as it factors in growth.\n\nHere's an intro to relative valuations by Aswath Damoradan:\n\n[Session 14: Relative Valuation - First Principles (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZwqSierZ4)\n\n# 5. Psychology of Investing\n\nYou should work on your own psychology to investing as soon as possible when you start investing. This will allow you to not panic sell during dips and crashes or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) during market rallies.\n\nThis is perhaps the most overlooked section, most investors never bother to get their psych in order which is a big mistake usually because of overconfidence of their own abilities.\n\n* [The Little Book of Behavioral Investing: How not to be your own worst enemy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Book-Behavioral-Investing-Profits/dp/0470686022)\n* [The Behavioral Investor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Behavioral-Investor-Daniel-Crosby/dp/0857196863/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=behavioural+investor&amp;qid=1608401405&amp;sr=8-1)\n\n# 6. Screeners\n\nYou should learn how to use screeners to narrow down stocks within your circle of competence and to the ratio's that you learned about in section 2. You want to screen for stocks that have below a certain threshold in x ratio, for example \\`PEG &lt; 1\\` which will screen all stocks for you that have a PEG of less than 1 (A PEG of &lt; 1 is theoretically undervalued...sometimes). It's best to combine multiple ratio's together to really narrow down to a select few companies to look at. This saves a bunch of time in finding potentially good companies.\n\nThe ratio's I like to use were all mentioned in section 2.\n\nScreeners dump:\n\n* [https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit#scanners](https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit#scanners)\n\nScreeners I personally like best:\n\n* [Finviz (Free)](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx)\n* [GuruFocus (Paid)](https://www.gurufocus.com/screener)\n\n# 7. Value Investing\n\nThe easiest way to make money long term in the stock market is to simple buy undervalued stocks, this ties into value investing. It's a simple concept where if you buy something undervalued then sooner or later the market will realize it's undervalued and correct accordingly (most times, sometimes it can stay undervalued forever). A lot of people mistake value investing for price to book ratio or some trash ratio like that, value investing is simply the concept of buying a stock for less than its intrinsic worth (i.e a margin of safety).\n\nYou **must** read the following books:\n\n1. [Benjamin Graham - Intelligent Investor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Practical/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=intelligent+investor+edition&amp;qid=1608384157&amp;sr=8-3)\n2. [Benjamin Graham - Security Analysis, Sixth Edition](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Security-Analysis-Foreword-Buffett-Editions/dp/0071592539)\n\nThese are the staples of value investing and what Warren Buffet read multiple times. They are difficult and long books to understand at first which is why I have put them in the 6th section so don't worry if you don't understand everything at first.\n\n# 8. Accounting\n\nTo be able to read Financial Statement numbers you really need to know how accounting works, both for GAAP (U.S) and IFRS (Most of Rest of World).\n\nThe reason why you should know accounting is not only to spot red flags in financial statements but also to understand the downsides of accounting. For example, only recently in 2018 were companies required to include Capital Leases in their balance sheets liabilities. Before then, companies could hide it in Off-Balance sheet statements that few people looked at, grossly inflating the viability of some businesses with heavy lease requirements.\n\n* [David Krug - Accounting 1 Full Course (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkZ6Q67Q15E&amp;list=PL301238C9BC6E0B83)\n* [David Krug - Accounting 2 Full Course (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cC9SZ3RC8Y&amp;list=PLHhe-2tIHRqEw5JRX6trtsLLlwwbpdXJX)\n* [Aswath Damoradan - Accounting 101 (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbp3-AU9v_g&amp;list=PLUkh9m2BorqmKaLrNBjKtFDhpdFdi8f7C)\n* [Howard Schilit - Financial Shenanigans, How to Detect Accounting Gimmicks &amp; Fraud in Financial Reports](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Financial-Shenanigans-Accounting-Gimmicks-Reports/dp/0071703071)\n\nDavid Krug's courses are an in depth full courses on accounting. You may not have the time to learn accounting in full though so if you do not then I would recommend the Accounting 101 course which fast tracks you to learn only what you need for our purposes.\n\nHoward Schilit's book will give you a good overview into the most common financial accounting tricks that you can try and spot.\n\n# 9. Monte Carlo Simulations &amp; Data/Statistics\n\nThis section is completely optional and not necessary but allows you to fine tune your assumptions.\n\nSo monte-carlo simulations are simulations that run thousands of times on your valuation models (such as your DCF model) to simulate multiple cases in your models. So instead of just doing a bear case and a bull case in your DCF model you can run a monte-carlo simulation and give your boundaries for your inputs (e.g 25% with a std. deviation of +/- 5%) and you will get a range of different outputs, in our case estimated prices per share and then you can use the mean price as your estimated price per share.\n\n* [Aswath Damoradan - A Monte Carlo Simulation Guide (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFd_qEpYFBc)\n* [Simular Monte Carlo Simulation Excel Plugin (Free)](https://www.simularsoft.com.ar/)\n* [RiskAMP Monte Carlo Simulation Excel](https://www.riskamp.com/)\n* [Comparison of Monte Carlo Excel Plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_risk_analysis_Microsoft_Excel_add-ins)\n* [Khan Academy - Probabilities and Statistics Full Course (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzkc-qNVoOk&amp;list=PLC58778F28211FA19)\n\n# 10. Useful DD's and Blogs\nOne of the ways I find new stocks to look into is by reading blogs and posts about undervalued stocks. Here's a couple that I like:\n\n- [DK Value Investing Stocks](https://dkvalue.blogspot.com/)\n- [Aswath Damodaran Blog](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/)\n- [Stock Chartist](https://thestockchartist.com/pages/value-investment-strategy)\n- [Macro ops Research](https://macro-ops.com/research/)\n- [UK Progressive Research](https://www.progressive-research.com/research-centre/)\n\n\nWell... if you've made it this far then congratz. It's a lot to learn, basically a full time job to learn all of it. And that's the point, if it was easy everyone would be rich.\n\nA final point is that a lot of the above links are from prof. Aswath Damoradan. The reason is that I have found him to be the absolute best source of information in regards to valuation ever and everything he publishes is completely free.\n\nThanks!",

        "title": "TIP: Pay attention to accounts receivable when reading financial statements (Accounts Receivable Days)",
        "selftext": "Hi Value Investors, \n\nI read book called 'Financial Shenanigans, How To Detect Accounting Gimmicks &amp; Fraud In Financial Reports' and I wanted to share something I thought was interesting that CEO's and corporate managers can use to manipulate earnings and receive a better compensation than they should. \n\nFor members who haven't heard of it, accounts receivable days is a metric used by analysts to detect the average time a customer takes to pay back a business for products and services purchased. In other words, it's simply used to measure how long it takes for businesses to receive payment on an invoice after a sale was made. As you already know, any sale that is made to a customer but the customer still hasn't paid for the product or service, then it still counts as revenue on the income statement and gets added to accounts receivable on the balance sheet. \n\nNow, comparing accounts receivable days (A/R days) between different companies isn't really viable since different companies offer different payment terms. For example, one retailer can offer payment plans allowing the buyer to pay off the product in instalments over 30-days and another retailer can offer a buyer to pay off the product in 60-days. In this scenario, we should expect that the first company have lower A/R days than the second company. So I don't really compare A/R days with other businesses, even in the same industry. \n\nWhen I'm looking through the financial statements, I compare A/R days of the company over the past 5-10 years and see if there is a 'jump' or a 'boost' in A/R in a given year. Then go over the proxy statements and find out if the executive officers were compensated on revenue growth, or 'top line' and/or 'net income' growth. Since Net Income Growth isn't the actual cash that is left over. If they are compensated on revenue growth or net income growth and there is a unprecedented surge in A/R days in the same year, you can expect that management artificially boosted their revenue by lowering their credit standards to customers, customers that are more likely to not pay back the company, just to increase their sales to boost their compensation package, leaving shareholders in the company to bear the cost. Not only would the sales be fake but we will have to dilute our ownership position and reduce our equity position in the company. \n\nTo calculate A/R Days: Accounts Receivable Days = (Accounts Receivable/Total Revenue)\\*365. The answer will be the average amounts of days a customer pays back the company. \n\nCompare this with previous years and see if you notice anything unusual. Just a tip. Let me know what you all think!\n\nI have a video about it which you can see on my profile.",

Berkshire because of questions about what is the company like when Buffett and Munger pass away. Nvidia I think may still be the leader in GPUs but never get back to previous all time highs due to decreased crypto mining demand. \n\nJP Morgan and Visa could flirt in and out of the top ten also.\n\nWhat companies do you think will be out of the top ten in 5-10 year?

I was fascinated by it and thought I'd share it here  \n\n\nIn 1923, Floyd Odlum, a friend, and their wives together pooled a total of $39,600 and formed \"The United States Company\" to speculate in purchases of utilities and general securities. Within two years, the company's net assets had increased 17x to nearly $700,000.  In short, Odlum searched for fifty-cent dollars and\u00a0scoured every corner of the market. According to documents from *the Eisenhower Library,* Odlum preferred two kinds of investments:\n\n* Utility stocks\n* Special situations\n\nBetween 1925 \u2013 1928, Odlum steadily grew the partnership. By investing in utilities and special situations, The United States Company AUM grew to $6M (over $88M adjusted for inflation). It was around this time that Odlum began sensing euphoria in the market. He smelled a top and he decided it was time for him to act.   \nIn 1929, he rolled his original partnership into a new vehicle, The Atlas Corporation. Wary of a market top, Odlum sold half his assets. He stayed in cash and issued $9M worth of Atlas Corporation securities. With $14M in cash, Floyd sat on his hands. Waiting for the next market crash, which shortly followed \n\nAfter the crash of 1929 and during the Great Depression, Floyd Odlum bought 22 investment trusts at a very low price and was regularly described as \u201cpossibly the only man in the United States who made a great fortune out of the Depression\u201d.  \n\nRead the incredible story in ful here - [https://macroops.substack.com/p/the-greatest-value-investor-youve?r=6gq23&amp;utm\\_medium=ios](https://macroops.substack.com/p/the-greatest-value-investor-youve?r=6gq23&amp;utm_medium=ios)",

I liked him on youtube, liked his investing philosophy, he seemed authentic, he said smart things and I learned a lot from him and also I felt like his expensive platform gave some value to me because he explained his reasoning. (although he didn\u2019t update it too regularly so I was already somewhat disappointed)\n\nHe always communicated his buys and sells shortly after he did them and he always described in detail why he did what.

        "title": "Is Google Stock a Buy?",
        "selftext": "Google Stock is down nearly 25% year to date. Is this a good time to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at its business.\n\n**Overview**\n\nGoogle has three main business segments: 1) Google Services which include Android, Chrome, Hardware, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube; 2) Google Cloud; 3) Other Bets which include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from its core Google business.\n\n**Business Model**\n\nGoogle makes money primarily from advertising which accounts for 80% of its total revenue. The advertising business is not just from Google search but also from Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play, YouTube Ads, and Google Network.\u00a0\n\n9.4% of its total revenue is from what it calls \u201cGoogle Others\u201d. It includes Google Play the app store, Devices like Fitbit wearable, Pixel, and home products, and YouTube non-advertising businesses such as premium and TV subscriptions.\u00a0\n\nThe rest of its revenue comes from Google Cloud and Other Bets.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nImages of the financial numbers can be found in my full post [here](https://coreinvesting.substack.com/p/is-google-stock-a-buy?r=1o7q0q&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web).\n\n**Business Competition**\n\nIn terms of search engine, Google competes with Bing, Yahoo!, Baidu, etc.. According to Statcounter, Google has over 91% market share worldwide. Its search engine is very strong.\n\nIn some vertical areas like E-commerce (e.g. Amazon, eBay), professional job sites (e.g. Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn), or even travel sites, Google search engine is weak because people navigate directly to such content rather than going through Google.\n\nSocial networks also eat Google\u2019s search business. More and more people are relying on social media to search and discover things.\u00a0\n\nIn terms of Cloud infrastructure, Google is behind Amazon and Microsoft. According to Statista, Amazon AWS has a 33% market share worldwide in Q1 2022, Microsoft Azure has a 21% market share, and Google Cloud has a 8% market share.\n\n**Google Strength and Conclusion**\n\nEven with all the competition above, I still think Google is attractive to buy now. From financial perspective, the stock is not expensive. Its PE ratio is 20.35 compared to the PE of SP500 22.84. The company has a $13B free cash flow with little debt. In April 2022, it announced to repurchase of $70.0 billion worth of its shares. As of June 30, 2022, [$58.9 billion remains available for repurchases](https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/20220726_alphabet_10Q.pdf?cache=de538c8).\u00a0\n\nFrom business perspective, Google search engine dominates the market with over 91% market share. Its adverting businesses still grow at a satisfactory rate even when some businesses reduced advertising spending due to the high-interest rate and the Ukraine war.\u00a0\n\nAndroid, the largest mobile operating system owned by Google, has 70% of the mobile operating system market share worldwide. For every application, you download and pay in the Google Play store and for every transaction, you make in the app, Google takes a cut of at least 15%. For example, with your subscription to Netflix, Google takes a cut for facilitating transactions through the Play Store where you downloaded the app.\u00a0\n\nGoogle\u2019s YouTube remains the most dominant social media platform. It has over 2 billion users. According to Pew Research Center, YouTube leads the way among teen users, with 95% of all teens regularly using the app. TikTok is the second in line.\n\nThe company is also making improvements on its core products to become more virtual and can understand complex queries and images.\n\nSubscribe to my [free newsletter](https://coreinvesting.substack.com/) for my stock analysis and investing posts.",

        "selftext": "I read Up Wall On Wall Street last year and I was playing around with Python programming, so I thought, why not try to get the PEG ratio for all the companies within S&amp;P? However, I made a few adjustments and filters along the way.\n\nThis post will be divided into three segments:\n\n1. My approach to calculating the PEG ratio (hence, why I mentioned adjusted in the title)\n2. The companies with a ratio below 1 (If you are only interested in that, well, you'll notice the table)\n3. The distribution of the S&amp;P500 companies based on the ratio\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **My approach**\n\nFirst of all, the PEG ratio (Price/Earnings ratio divided by growth) is a bit of an improved ratio compared to the traditional P/E ratio as it does take future growth into account.\n\nHowever, the P/E ratio on its own ignores a lot of information, so I made a few adjustments and will illustrate them with short examples. \n\nIf we have two identical companies that earn $100k/year in net income, each one with a market cap of $1m, the P/E ratio is the same = 10. However, what if one of the two companies had $500k in cash in addition? Well, in a perfect market, the market price will be $500k higher. This difference in the market price, although justified by the fundamentals (the excess cash), will result in this company having a P/E of 15 and appearing more expensive compared to the one without the cash.\n\nSo, I adjusted the market cap for the cash on the balance sheet &amp; the debt (for the same reason) and get close to enterprise value instead of the traditional market cap. Is this perfect? Not really, but the outcome is better.\n\nNow, once I have the P/E ratio, the next part is looking at growth.\n\nWhen there are events with high impacts (pandemic, wars, supply chain issues), in most cases there were temporary decreases/increases in earnings (part of the P/E ratio) and temporary growth/decline ahead that is not sustainable in the long run. So, as a proxy for net earnings growth, I took the average analyst estimates that are available on Yahoo Finance, two years down the line So the EPS growth from 2023 to 2024. Is this a perfect indicator for sustainable earnings growth? Absolutely not, it's quick and dirty and that's the best I can come up with.\n\nIn the book, Peter Lynch rightfully mentions that dividend yield should also be taken into account in addition to future sustainable growth. If a company pays out dividends, it has less cash remaining to re-invest and grow further. This should not lead to punishing the company measuring through this PEG ratio.\n\nSo the formula that I'm using is as follows:\n\n***(Enterprise value / Net income from continuing operations) divided by (Forecasted EPS growth + current dividend yield)***\n\nAfter running the script, I had the outcome for 374 companies. Not 500, as the future EPS forecast isn't available for all. There go 20% of the companies.\n\nAfterward, I had to filter out the companies with negative P/E ratios and negative EPS growth (for obvious reasons) and I was left with **278 companies**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Companies with PEG ratio below 1**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Name|PEG ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|NRG|NRG Energy Inc |0.2|\n|AIZ|Assurant, Inc. |0.28|\n|FOXA|Fox Corp Class A    |0.36|\n|TGT|Target|0.38|\n|MGM|MGM Resorts|0.38|\n|PVH|PVH Corp |0.39|\n|LUV|Southwest Airlines|0.44|\n|TER|Teradyne, Inc |0.46|\n|BBWI|Bath &amp; Body Works Inc |0.5|\n|BBY|Best Buy Co Inc|0.51|\n|FOX|Fox Corp Class B|0.53|\n|STX|Seagate Technology Holdings PLC|0.54|\n|DXC|DXC Technology Co|0.56|\n|HAl|Halliburton Company|0.59|\n|ATVI|Activision Blizzard, Inc|0.63|\n|HPE|Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co|0.64|\n|SLB|Schlumberger NV|0.64|\n|RL|Ralph Lauren Corp|0.64|\n|BWA|BorgWarner Inc|0.65|\n|DAL|Delta Air Lines, Inc|0.68|\n|GRMN|Garmin Ltd.|0.79|\n|CMI|Cummins Inc.|0.84|\n|MLM|Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.|0.84|\n|TPR|Tapestry Inc|0.87|\n|LMT|Lockheed Martin Corporation|0.88|\n|DLR|Digital Realty Trust, Inc|0.88|\n|AMAT|Applied Materials, Inc.|0.94|\n|EQR|Equity Residential|0.94|\n|HES|Hess Corp.|0.96|\n|NKE|Nike Inc|0.97|\n|PGR|PROG Holdings Inc|0.97|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3.

        "title": "Costco: Buy the hot dog, sell the stock.",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone! This is my first attempt at writing my interpretation of a company. I really suck at writing so I'm using this as an exercise to improve my skillset. I chose Costco because I constantly see comments that say a majority of their revenue comes from membership fees when that's completely wrong and that really bothers me. Please let me know what I can improve on/what you enjoyed. Thank you!\n\n**Overview:**\n\nTaken directly from their 10K: Costco operates membership warehouses and ecommerce websites based on the concept that offers members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private label products.\n\n**Financials:** All numbers in millions.\n\n**Revenue:**\n\n||TTM|'21|'20|'19|'18|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--\n|Net Sales|226,954|195,929|166,761|152,703|141,576\n|% YoY Growth|15.8%|17.5%|9.2%|7.9%|9.52%\n|Membership Fees|N/A|3,877|3,541|3,352|3,142\n|% of Revenue|N/A|2.02%|2.17%|2.24%|2.27%\n\nCostco's revenue has had incredible growth in the past 5 years. Their membership fees have mostly stayed flat as a % of revenue and only grown about high single digit growth (7-9%) YoY.\n\n**Gross Margin:**\n\n||TTM|21|20|19|18|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|Gross Profit|27,572|25,245|21,822|19817|18424|\n|Gross Margin|12.1%|12.9%|13.1%|13.0%|13.0%|\n\n**Operating Income:**\n\n||TTM|21|20|19|18|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|Operating Income|7,793|7,223|5,435|4,737|4,480|\n|Operating Margin|3.4%|3.7%|3.3%|3.1%|3.2%|\n\nAs we can see from the financials, Costco is very consistent when it comes to their margins. They enjoyed quite the revenue boost with the boost of stimulus during Covid and have already shown their growth is unsustainable, especially with Inflation as a headwind.\n\n**DCF Analysis:**\n\nOur inputs are simple: We will assume a 10% Growth Rate for the next 5 years declining to a risk-free rate for years 6-10. Truthfully, this is too optimistic for me given the current macro and Costco's already enormous revenue. When we look at comparable competitors such as WMT/TGT, we see revenue numbers more in line with 2-3%. I will also provide a DCF analysis more in line with those numbers.\n\n**Discount Rate/Wacc**- 7.81%. Costco has a very safe beta of 0.71, leading to a very low WACC, especially given the current macroenvironment.\n\n**Operating Income:** We will assume Costco will be able to maintain  a margin of 3.4% declining to a 3.1% margin by Year 10.\n\n**Output:**\n\n|||Implied Upside/Downside- Current Share Price: 466.40|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|Optimistic Case Implied Share Price|319.43|-31.51%|\n|Conserative Case Implied Share Price|224.19|-51.93%|\n\n\nMy analysis clearly states that Costco's fair value is significantly lower than what it's currently trading at. So what does Costco need to do to deserve it's current market cap? \n\nAfter playing around with my model, I found the easiest way would be to assume Costco will be able to maintain a 3.4% Operating Margin for years 1-10 while maintaining 10% revenue growth for Years 1-8, and most importantly assume the risk-free rate will drop to 1.2%. Hopefully after seeing how much needs to happen to achieve today's current valuation, you'll think differently about Costco. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile Costco has had a terrific runup in the past 5 years (183% vs SPY's 46%), it is incredibly difficult to justify it's lofty valuation, even with an optimistic outlook. Of course, I welcome any criticism and my optimistic outlook may be considered pessimistic in your eyes. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and I wish you all a great day!\n\nAlso insert typical this is not financial advice, trade at your own risk, yada yada yada",

        "title": "Trex: An Undervalued High-quality Compounder",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone! This is my first time writing out my analysis for a company. Of course, this is not financial advice and is just my opinion. I know that this post is quite bumpy in some places so please try and give me feedback on how I can improve. Thanks! :)\n\n# Business Overview\n\nTrex is a mid-cap company founded in 1996 and has quickly grown to become the largest manufacturer of composite decking and railing products in the world. It operates in 2 segments, namely commercial and residential, with the residential segment accounting for the vast majority of revenue (\\~95.2% in 2021). As such, the majority of this DD will focus on the residential segment.\n\n# Argument summary\n\nTrex is a high-quality, asset-light business able to generate superb returns on capital while simultaneously reinvesting capital into the business. It has an extremely robust balance sheet and is growing revenue, income and free cash flow at a sustainable mid-double digit rate due to management\u2019s impressive execution of its growth plans. Apart from business growth, shareholder return is also driven by strategically-timed share buybacks. Its industry leading position provides a strong moat in the form of a distribution network and share-of-mind advantage, giving the business significant pricing power. As expected, such a high-quality business trades at a slight premium valuation, but the sustainable growth and profitability the business is expected to maintain over minimally the next 10 years makes it an excellent long-term investment.\n\n# Financials\n\n**Balance Sheet**The company has a superb business sheet. In 2021, it had $920 million in total assets, with only $19.0 million of that being Goodwill &amp; other intangible assets. Its assets consist of $401 million current assets (of which an ample $141 million is cash &amp; cash equivalents), and $519 million noncurrent assets. It has no outstanding indebtedness, though it has a revolving credit facility with $300 million available borrowing capacity. In total, it has $195 million total liabilities and shareholder equity of $725 million.\n\nWith such a robust balance sheet, Trex is well-placed to comfortably navigate through the current volatile macroeconomic environment without solvency risks. This is consistent with the Trex\u2019s historical conservative financial position, showcasing management\u2019s financial competency.\n\n**Income Statement**Trex has had an impressive growth streak for the past decade. Revenue has increased from $267 million to $1.12 billion from 2011 to 2021, at a CAGR of 13.8%. Meanwhile, net income has increased from -$11.6 million to $209 million.\n\nIn the past 5 years, revenue increased from $480 million from 2016 to $1.12 billion in 2022, at a CAGR of 18.5%. Also, income increased from $68.0 million to $209 million, at a CAGR of 25.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, margins have remained consistently high throughout most of the past decade: 2021 gross and net margins were 38.5% and 17.4% respectively. This is consistent with the \\~40% gross and 17% net margins the company has experienced for the past few years.\n\nWith such high profitability, In 2021, ROCE was 33.1% while ROIC was 34.1%. Over the past few years, Trex has maintained similar ROCE and ROIC levels of \\~35-40%, even as the balance sheet as a whole has increased notably over time. This shows Trex\u2019s ability to generate high returns on incremental capital, a hallmark of a good business. Moreover, the sustained high returns is a testament to the strengths of Trex\u2019s moats, such that it has prevented competitors from affecting its returns, which is wholly aligned with what Buffett searches for in businesses.\n\n**Cash Flow Statement**Trex uses almost all of its cash flow from operating activities to repurchase shares and invest in PPE. It does not pay a dividend.\n\n# Growth &amp; Strategies\n\nTrex is pursuing long-term sustainable growth through multiple avenues. Namely, it seeks to grow its business through\n\n* Maintaining / increasing product innovation and quality\n* Growing brand prestige &amp; reputation\n* Greater coverage of geographic channels\n* Lowering production costs\n\nThe first two factors are more qualitative approaches to growth, lacking much quantitative data to justify their existence. However, Trex does have the historical records to prove its ability to grow both factors: both are affirmed through Trex\u2019s product line which has expanded throughout the years, its status as the leading composite decking company in the world, and its perception as the highest quality manufacturer of composite decking in the world. Also, Trex is currently releasing its new generation of Trex Transcend decking, which is its premium line of decking, and cladding, which is largely for commercial applications.\n\nThe other two factors have been approached through Trex\u2019s reinvesting back into the business. Most of its cash flow from operations is being used to reinvest back into PPE for the business (change in PPE / cash flow from operating activities was 61.2%, 97.2%, and 46.5% in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively). These investments are primarily used to reduce production costs while simultaneously increasing capacity expansion. Over the past few years, Trex has completed a capital expenditure program at its facilities in Virginia and Nevada to increase production output, and this was completed in 2021. Looking forward, Trex is constructing a third U.S.-based Trex Residential manufacturing facility in Little Rock, Arkansas, and initial production output is expected to start in 2024. The construction of the Little Rock facility takes place in a modular approach, with management expecting to spend $400 million on the Little Rock facility in the next 5 years, and the facility is expected to be able to become Trex\u2019s largest manufacturing facility eventually. This allows for long-term sustainable future growth in revenue, and by extension net income.\n\nAlso, to further generate shareholder value, Trex repurchases shares, though it does not pay a dividend. Adjusted for stock splits, since diluted shares outstanding peaked in 2013, share count has decreased at a CAGR of -2.06% to 2021. Management\u2019s share purchase execution has also been strategic: the share count CAGR between 2019 and 2021 (when valuations were extremely rich)  being only -0.443%. Meanwhile, amidst the nearly 50% share price drop in the past year, share count has decreased by 2.07% YoY from June 2021 to June 2022. If prices decline further in the short-term or trade sideways, it is expected that management will maintain the elevated share repurchase rate in the short to medium term. Management\u2019s decision to repurchase shares instead of paying a dividend is affirmation for shareholders as it shows to a certain degree that management believes shares are at least slightly undervalued.\n\nTrex is also focusing on growing internationally, and has been sold in 40 countries excluding the U.S., and has sales staff in Europe and Australia. It also has ample cash and a management team that has expressed openness to engage in future acquisitions. Moreover, Trex is supported by the large industry headwinds, with *Research and Markets* estimating the global composite decking market to grow at a CAGR of 11.2% to 2027. When coupled with Trex\u2019s increasing market share in the composite decking market due to its various growth initiatives, as well as its cost cutting measures, Trex is very-well positioned to grow profits at a steady double-digit rate in the long term.\n\nWith all these growth factors, Trex has achieved very sustainable, long-term tailwinds for growth. Despite short to medium-term volatility and potential declines in revenues and profits due to a declining macroeconomic situation, Trex\u2019s long-term growth story remains robust, and should be able to maintain its mid-double digit growth rates in the long-term.\n\n# Moat\n\n**Moat Types**Trex has 2 moats in the form of a strong distribution network and share of mind advantage.\n\nTrex has over 6700 stocking locations and has the strongest distribution and dealer network in the industry. It also has 2 national retail merchandisers, as well as 50 worldwide distributors. This distribution network is difficult to replicate in its strength, which prevents competitors from competing in the same geographic scale that Trex does.\n\nTrex\u2019s share-of-mind moat comes from its industry-leading position in composite decking, along with the high brand prestige and reputation that it has cultivated over the years, such that many people interested in composite decking will turn to Trex immediately. Trex is also maintaining this moat through its product expansion and marketing campaign, with the new 2022 marketing campaign \u201cWe See It Too\u201d emphasising Trex\u2019s decks as the foundation for a lifetime of memories. Trex also has the highest search interest in the composite decking category, and hence has more web traffic and exposure for its contractors and dealers, which further increases Trex\u2019s brand awareness, helping to prevent competitors from taking away market share from Trex.\n\n**Competition**Trex maintains that its primary competition is not other composite decking manufacturers, but wood products. As of 2021, composite decking made up 25% of market share while wood made up the other 75%. Trex estimates that for every 1% increase in composite wood decking market share, there will be +$80 million in annual composite decking sales. This market share is increasing at a significant rate, as composite wood decking market share increased by 3 percentage points from 2020 to 2021 alone. Compared to wood, Trex believes that its decks offer a value proposition as despite the higher initial cost of its products, they can be used for longer periods of time with higher quality due to their lack of rotting, warping, splintering, fading and other unfavourable processes that are associated with wood products. Trex believes that for this value proposition to translate into greater sales, it needs to increase consumer awareness, which it has been doing successfully to a large extent, as evident in the increasing composite wood decking market share.\n\n# Discounted Cash Flow Valuation\n\n**Assumptions**  \nAssuming maintenance capex = depreciation + amortisation, 2021 owners\u2019 earnings = operating cash flow - (depreciation + amortisation) = 204 million. Due to the very sustainable growth rates, I estimate owners\u2019 earnings growth to be 15.0% for the next 5 years, then slowly declining to 5.0% by year 10. I do believe this to be rather conservative due to how sustainable and long-lasting Trex\u2019s growth tailwinds are, and the fact that it has a lot of room to further expand internationally beyond the next few years.\n\nFor the discount rate, I used Trex\u2019s WACC to calculate it (calculated to be 10.4%). This relatively low WACC in the current macroeconomic environment is due to Trex\u2019s lack of debt.\n\nI calculated terminal value based on both the exit multiple method and perpetual growth method. For the exit multiple method, I assigned an exit multiple of 18x owners\u2019 earnings, and assigned the perpetual growth method a perpetual growth rate of 4.0%.\n\n**Output**\n\n|Method|Sum from first 10 years / billion $|Terminal Value / bilion $|Share Price Fair Value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Exit multiple method|2.57|4.06|$58.57|\n|Perpetual growth method|2.57|3.91|$57.24|\n\nBoth of these are lower than Trex\u2019s current price of $45.22 (as of writing), providing a margin of safety of 22.8% and 21.0% respectively, which makes Trex in my view substantially undervalued.  \n\n\nDCF Calculation  \n\n\n|Year|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Owners' Earnings / million|203.7|234.3|269.4|309.8|356.3|409.8|458.9|504.8|545.2|577.9|606.8|\n|Discounted Earnings / million|203.7|212.2|221.0|230.2|239.8|249.9|253.5|252.5|247.1|237.2|225.6|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TLDR\n\nI believe that Trex is a high-quality business compounding at sustainable mid-double digit rates, able to sustain high rates of ROIC and ROCE, and has excellent moats and management. Also, it is notably undervalued.\n\n# Remarks\n\nThank you so much for reading this entire post! What are your thoughts on Trex? Of course, all comments and criticism are welcome. Feel free to share about Trex as well as my analysis. Have a great day! :)  \n\n\nEdit 1: Hi everyone, thanks so much for your kind remarks!

        "selftext": "This is a post intended for entertainment/educational purposes only.\n\nAs someone who enjoyed the game of chess and has a background in finance and valuation, I thought it would be fun to attempt and value the [Chess.com](https://Chess.com) website. Not the entire company (that includes Play Magnus, Chessable, their social media platforms, etc), but only the website.\n\nI did my best to estimate the active users on the platform, the split between free and premium users, the revenue that the website generates from each, and the profit margin. Feel free to make assumptions that are significantly different than mine and to share insights that could help in the process.\n\nAs it is a private company, with limited public information available, this has been a lot of fun! I hope that is being appreciated here.\n\nThe link is here and below you can find the analysis in written form for those who prefer to read: [https://youtu.be/GlqgOLSdrlA](https://youtu.be/GlqgOLSdrlA)\n\nIn a nutshell, the websites generate money both from the free users (through ads) and the premium users (through the subscription).\n\nHowever, these numbers aren't available anywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The number of users**\n\nBased on Wikipedia, [Chess.com](https://Chess.com) has over 95m members. Can this be trusted? Not really, there's no source and it doesn't point out to the **active** users. The inactive ones are irrelevant for understanding the value of the website as they don't generate any revenue.\n\nBased on a simple Google search, I got two results, both coming from the website:\n\n1. A sponsored Google ad where the website is the place to meet over **40m** chess players\n2. The [Chess.com](https://Chess.com) website itself that mentions there are over **50m** members from around the world.\n\nNot only that the Wikipedia numbers are too high, but the [Chess.com](https://Chess.com) website also isn't aligned internally. It is either that the Google ad has been on autopilot since they had 40m users, or there are 10m who just don't want to meet you.\n\nIn any case, none of this points out to the active users, which is what is most important.\n\nSo, I looked into the online players and noted the numbers down at different times of the day. The average was around 240k. That means, on average, there are 240k users who play chess on the platform. Of course, this is at a point in time. How can we get to the total? Also, someone who plays 60 blitz games a day is more valuable than someone who plays fa ew games a week. So many variables! So, what can be done?\n\nI looked at a poll on how much time per day is being spent playing/studying chess. The average was around 1 hour. That helps with the equation. Basically, if 240k is the average number of online players and on average they play for an hour, there are 5,760,000 active users on any given day (240k multiplied by 24 hours).\n\nI looked at a few tournaments to identify how many of the users have a flair (pointing out that they are premium members) and noticed that I get somewhere between 10 and 11%. However, the premium users have the option to not use a flair. I would assume that these are the minority, so my split between free and premium users was 88% - 12%.\n\nThat leads to 5,068,800 free users and 691,200 premium users active on average during a day.\n\nThere aren't that many ads on the website, so it is definitely not the case that the website makes lots of money through that. I estimated that at $1 per member per year. That assumes around 400/500 ads seen by an active member (that's logging every day), between 1 and 2 a day.\n\nAs for the premium users, there are various packages, so I assumed the average is around $7/month.\n\nThis seems logical, however, the number of premium users is currently understated if I multiply them with the subscription, basically, it means that the same 691,200 users are online every day, which isn't the case. The 691,200 premium users are the average that I estimated to be online on a given day. Chess, as many will agree, is a pretty addictive game. So, I assumed that on average, 50% of the premium users are online on any given day, doubling the # of premium users to 1,382,400.\n\n**The financials**\n\nTaking the numbers above, the revenue of [Chess.com](https://Chess.com) in any given year is $121,190,400. A company in this industry has a net profit margin of anywhere between 15% and 25%. Assuming theirs is 20%, the estimated yearly profit is around $24,238,080.\n\nBased on the fundamentals of the company (and some data coming from Google Trends), I expect that the # of members slowly increases over time (&lt;5% a year), hence I'm using a so-called \"P/E multiple\" of 14.\n\nThis brings the valuation of the website to $339,333,120.\n\nCould I be wrong? Absolutely! Look at all the assumptions that I made.\n\n**What if?**\n\nIf I overstated the # of premium users, combined with the average premium subscription of $7 and the profit margin and the P/E ratio, then the valuation could decrease to **$155m.**\n\nOn the other hand, if I underestimated them, the valuation could go as high as **$672m.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hans Niemann's lawsuit**\n\nOne segment in the lawsuit refers to [Chess.com](https://Chess.com) as a \"multi-billion dollar behemoth\".\n\nBased on my analysis, I cannot justify a valuation even to $1bn, let alone over $2bn.\n\nFor this to be the case, the website needs to have over 6m premium users which, if we reverse engineer the formula, means that only 14% of the premium users are online on any given day. This, I find too low, taking into account the addictiveness of chess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you enjoyed this!",

For now, just know that I\u2019m committing to getting you this list of high-quality stocks through 2023, and hopefully beyond.\u00a0\n\n# What is The Buffett Score?\n\nThe Buffett Score is made up of 8 checklist criteria that were pulled from the book Buffettology by Mary Buffett. The hope is that the score will help us uncover high-quality stocks, especially in an environment like we\u2019re seeing right now.\u00a0\n\nLast year, the score gave us 111 stocks to choose from (it was a bit more lenient last year), and if you\u2019d have equally bought all 111 stocks you\u2019d have enjoyed a 3% alpha over the S&amp;P 500. Yes, you\u2019d have still lost money overall, but less than the broader market. If you were a Facebook hater and removed that from the 111 stocks, you\u2019d have enjoyed even more alpha.\u00a0\n\nHere are the 8 rules:\n\n1. The company should have consistent earnings\n2. The company should have manageable debt\n3. The company should have a high return on equity (&gt;15%)\n4. The company should have a high return on invested capital (&gt;12%)\n5. The company should be FCF positive\n6. The company should not be issuing new shares (over a 5yr timeframe, so some issuance + retiring is ok)\n7. The company's earnings yield should be greater than the return from a 10yr treasury\n8. Finally, a company's FCF should be \"outsized\" when compared against that company's assets.\n\n# Stocks\n\nThere are 33 stocks that check all the boxes above. I\u2019ll spare you my analysis and leave them here (I\u2019d love to hear thoughts / discuss in the comments though):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Name|Sector|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|AAPL|Apple Inc|Computers|\n|AMAT|Applied Materials Inc|Electronic Equipment|\n|BIIB|Biogen Inc|Pharmaceutical Products|\n|CORT|Corcept Therapeutics Inc|Pharmaceutical Products|\n|CSCO|Cisco Systems Inc|Computers|\n|EVR|Evercore Inc|Trading|\n|FHI|Federated Hermes Inc|Trading|\n|GNTX|Gentex Corp|Automobiles and Trucks|\n|HCC|Warrior Met Coal Inc|Coal|\n|INVA|Innoviva Inc|Pharmaceutical Products|\n|ITW|Illinois Tool Works Inc|Machinery|\n|KFRC|Kforce Inc|Business Services|\n|LOPE|Grand Canyon Education Inc|Personal Services|\n|LPX|Louisiana-Pacific Corp|Construction Materials|\n|LSTR|Landstar System Inc|Transportation|\n|MARPS|Marine Petroleum Trust|Trading|\n|MCFT|Mastercraft Boat Holdings Inc|Shipbuilding Railroad Equipment|\n|MED|Medifast Inc|Food Products|\n|MSB|Mesabi Trust|Trading|\n|NVEC|Nve Corp|Electronic Equipment|\n|NVR|Nvr Inc|Construction|\n|POWI|Power Integrations Inc|Electronic Equipment|\n|RGR|Sturm Ruger &amp; Co Inc|Defense|\n|RHI|Robert Half International Inc|Business Services|\n|SEIC|Sei Investments Co|Trading|\n|SIG|Signet Jewelers Ltd|Retail|\n|SIGA|Siga Technologies Inc|Pharmaceutical Products|\n|SWBI|Smith &amp; Wesson Brands Inc|Defense|\n|TER|Teradyne Inc|Measuring and Control Equipment|\n|TROW|Price T Rowe Group Inc|Trading|\n|TXN|Texas Instruments Inc|Electronic Equipment|\n|UG|United Guardian Inc|Consumer Goods|\n|WSM|Williams Sonoma Inc|Retail|\n\n# More Info\n\nI\u2019ll continue posting here on the first of every month. I\u2019ll also be posting on [BuffettScore.com](https://BuffettScore.com), and there\u2019s likely to be a bit of additional information there.\u00a0\n\nI also plan on doing a deep dive of a \u201crandom\u201d stock from the list each month - and this month it\u2019s going to be Gentex. I know absolutely nothing about this company other than what I see on its homepage so it should be fun to dive in a little bit and understand more about how it ended up passing every check on the Buffett Score checklist.\u00a0\n\nAny questions, feedback, or thoughts, let me know below!\u00a0",

        "title": "Apple Makes Plans to Move Production Out of China - Wall Street Journal",
        "selftext": "(Warren Buffett - Berkshire Hathaway's largest portfolio holding)\n\nWell written article that details Apple's challenges in changing their manufacturing and supply chains.  Long term, I'm expecting this to result in additional price increases for iPhones, above those related to global inflation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe iPhone maker is looking to diversify the supply chain that has powered its growth\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy Yang Jie and Aaron Tilley\n\nDec. 3, 2022 12:00 am ET\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn recent weeks, Apple Inc. has accelerated plans to shift some of its production outside China, long the dominant country in the supply chain that built the world\u2019s most valuable company, say people involved in the discussions. It is telling suppliers to plan more actively for assembling Apple products elsewhere in Asia, particularly India and Vietnam, they say, and looking to reduce dependence on Taiwanese assemblers led by Foxconn Technology Group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurmoil at a place called iPhone City helped propel Apple\u2019s shift. At the giant city-within-a-city in Zhengzhou, China, as many as 300,000 workers work at a factory run by Foxconn to make iPhones and other Apple products. At one point, it alone made about 85% of the Pro lineup of iPhones, according to market-research firm Counterpoint Research. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Zhengzhou factory was convulsed in late November by violent protests. In videos posted online, workers upset about wages and Covid-19 restrictions could be seen throwing items and shouting \u201cStand up for your rights!\u201d Riot police were present, the videos show. The location of one of the videos was verified by the news agency and video-verification service Storyful. The Wall Street Journal corroborated events shown in the videos with workers at the site.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComing after a year of events that weakened China\u2019s status as a stable manufacturing center, the upheaval means Apple no longer feels comfortable having so much of its business tied up in one place, according to analysts and people in the Apple supply chain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIn the past, people didn\u2019t pay attention to concentration risks,\u201d said Alan Yeung, a former U.S. executive for Foxconn. \u201cFree trade was the norm and things were very predictable. Now we\u2019ve entered a new world.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne response, say the people involved in Apple\u2019s supply chain, is to draw from a bigger pool of assemblers\u2014even if those companies are themselves based in China. Two Chinese companies that are in line to get more Apple business, they say, are Luxshare Precision Industry Co. and Wingtech Technology Co. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn calls with investors earlier this year, Luxshare executives said some consumer-electronics clients, which they didn\u2019t name, were worried about Chinese supply-chain snafus caused by Covid-19 prevention measures, power shortages and other issues. They said these clients wanted Luxshare to help them do more work outside China.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe executives referred to what is known as new product introduction, or NPI, when Apple assigns teams to work with contractors in translating its product blueprints and prototypes into a detailed manufacturing plan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is the guts of what it takes to actually build hundreds of millions of gadgets, and an area where China, with its concentration of production engineers and suppliers, has excelled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApple has told its manufacturing partners that it wants them to start trying to do more of this work outside of China, according to people involved in the discussions. Unless places such as India and Vietnam can do NPI too, they will remain stuck playing second fiddle, say supply-chain specialists. However, the slowing global economy and slowing hiring at Apple have made it hard for the tech giant to allocate personnel for NPI work with new suppliers and new countries, said some of the people in the discussions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApple and China have spent decades tying themselves together in a relationship that, until now, has mostly been mutually beneficial. Change won\u2019t come overnight. Apple still puts out new iPhone models every year, alongside steady updates of its iPads, laptops and other products. It must keep flying the plane while replacing an engine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cFinding all the pieces to build at the scale Apple needs is not easy,\u201d said Kate Whitehead, a former Apple operations manager who now owns her own supply-chain consulting firm.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet the transition is under way, driven by two causes that are feeding on each other to threaten China\u2019s historic economic strength. Some Chinese youth are no longer eager to work for modest wages assembling electronics for the affluent. They are seething in part because of Beijing\u2019s heavy-handed Covid-19 approach, itself a concern for Apple and many other Western companies. Three years after Covid-19 started circulating, China is still trying to crush outbreaks with measures such as quarantines, as many other countries have returned to prepandemic norms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProtests in Chinese cities over the past week, during which some demonstrators called for the ouster of President Xi Jinping, suggested criticism over Covid-19 restrictions could build into a larger movement against the government.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll this comes on top of more than five years of heightened U.S.-China military and economic tensions under the Trump and Biden administrations over China\u2019s rapidly expanding military footprint and U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, among other disputes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApple\u2019s longer-term goal is to ship 40% to 45% of iPhones from India, compared with a single-digit percentage currently, according to Ming-chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities who follows the supply chain. Suppliers say Vietnam is expected to shoulder more of the manufacturing for other Apple products such as AirPods, smartwatches and laptops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor now, consumers doing Christmas shopping are stuck with some of the longest wait times for high-end iPhones in the product\u2019s 15-year history, stretching until after Christmas. Apple issued a rare midquarter warning in November that shipments of the Pro models would be hurt by Covid-19 restrictions at the Zhengzhou facility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn November, as the worker protests in the facility grew, Apple issued a statement assuring it was on the ground looking to resolve the issue. \u201cWe are reviewing the situation and working closely with Foxconn to ensure their employees\u2019 concerns are addressed,\u201d a spokesman said at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe risk of too much concentration in China has long been known to Apple executives, yet for years they did little to lessen it. China supplied a literate and diligent workforce, political stability and a huge local market for Apple\u2019s products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTaiwan-based Foxconn, under founder Terry Gou, became an essential link between Apple in California and the Chinese assembly plants where iPhones get put together. Foxconn managers share a language and cultural background with mainland workers. Pegatron Corp., another Taiwan-based contractor, has played a smaller but similar role.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd both the government in Beijing and local governments in places such as Henan province, home to the Zhengzhou plant, have enthusiastically supported Apple\u2019s business, seeing it as an engine of jobs and growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven now, when ever-harsher anti-American rhetoric flows each day from Beijing over issues such as Taiwan and human rights, that backing remains strong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople\u2019s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, hailed the Apple production site in a Nov. 20 video, saying it accounted directly or indirectly for more than a million local jobs. Foxconn shipped about $32 billion in products overseas from Zhengzhou in 2019, according to a Chinese government-linked think tank. All told, the Foxconn group accounted for 3.9% of China\u2019s exports in 2021, according to the company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s timely assistance\u2026continuously provides a sense of certainty for multinational companies like Apple, as well as for the world\u2019s supply chain,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily video said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet such words ring hollow to many U.S. businesses in light of stringent anti-Covid measures by the government that have hampered production and roused worker unrest. A survey by the U.S.-China Business Council this year found American companies\u2019 confidence in China has fallen to a record low, with about a quarter of respondents saying they have at least temporarily moved parts of their supply chain out of China over the past year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo keep operating during government Covid-19 measures, the Zhengzhou factory is among those compelled to adopt a system in which workers stay on-site and contact with the outside world is limited to the bare minimum to keep the goods flowing. Foxconn has sealed smoking areas, switched off vending machines and closed dining halls in favor of carryout meals that workers bring back to their dormitories, often a half-hour walk away, workers said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany have escaped, jumping fences and walking along empty highways to get back to their hometowns. In November, the pandemic policies and pay disputes further fueled workers\u2019 grievances. Some clashed with police at the site and left smashed glass doors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany of those abandoning the factory were young people who said on social media that they decided wages equivalent to $5 or less an hour weren\u2019t enough to compensate for tedious production work, exacerbated by Covid-19 restrictions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better for us to skate by at home than to be sucked dry by capitalists,\u201d one person who identified herself as a departed Foxconn worker posted on her social-media account after the protests.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAsked for comment, a Foxconn spokesman referred to earlier statements in which the company blamed a computer error for some of the pay issues raised by new hires. It said it guaranteed recruits would be paid what was promised in recruitment ads. The spokesman declined to comment further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChina\u2019s Covid-19 policy \u201chas been an absolute gut punch to Apple\u2019s supply chain,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. \u201cThis last month in China has been the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for Apple in China.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. Kuo, the supply-chain analyst, said iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter of this year were likely to reach around 70 million to 75 million units, which he said was around 10 million fewer than market projections before the Zhengzhou turmoil. The top-of-the-line iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models have been particularly hard-hit, he said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccounts vary about how many workers are missing from the Zhengzhou factory, with estimates ranging from the thousands to the tens of thousands. Mr. Kuo said it was running at about 20% capacity in November, a figure expected to improve to 30% to 40% in December. One positive sign came Wednesday, when the local government in Zhengzhou lifted lockdown restrictions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne Foxconn manager said hundreds of workers were mobilized to move machinery and components by truck and plane nearly 1,000 miles from Zhengzhou in central China to Shenzhen in the south, where Foxconn has its other main factories in China. The Shenzhen factories have made up some, but not all, of the production gap. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, Foxconn is offering money to get workers to come back and stay for a while. One of its offers is a bonus of up to $1,800 for January to full-time workers in Zhengzhou who joined at the start of November or earlier. Those who wanted to quit have gotten $1,400. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIndia and Vietnam have their own challenges.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDan Panzica, a former Foxconn executive who now advises companies on supply-chain issues, said Vietnam\u2019s manufacturing was growing quickly but was short of workers. The country has just under 100 million people, less than a 10th of China\u2019s population. It can handle 60,000-person manufacturing sites but not places such as Zhengzhou that reach into the hundreds of thousands, he said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not doing high-end phones in India and Vietnam,\u201d said Mr. Panzica. \u201cNo other places can do them.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIndia has a population nearly the size of China\u2019s but not the same level of governmental coordination. Apple has found it hard to navigate India because each state is run differently and regional governments saddle the company with obligations before letting it build products there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIndia is the Wild West in terms of consistent rules and getting stuff in and out,\u201d said Mr. Panzica.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe U.S. embassies of India and Vietnam didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNonetheless, \u201cApple is going to have to find multiple places to replace iPhone City,\u201d Mr. Panzica said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to spread it around and make more villages instead of big cities.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2014Selina Cheng contributed to this article.",
