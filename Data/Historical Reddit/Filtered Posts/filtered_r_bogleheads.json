        "selftext": "I was doing some reading today and came across an article from 2011 that features what Jack Bogle said to investors during the aftermath of the Great Recession. I think it's a good reminder especially during this time of market turmoil and I decided to post a couple excerpts. \n\n*\"My rule -- and it's good only about 99% of the time, so I have to be  careful here -- when these crises come along, the best rule you can  possible follow is not \"Don't stand there, do something,\" but \"Don't do  something, stand there!\"* said Bogle.

Warren Buffet isn't just lucky.\n\nIn mid-February, I understood that the COVID-19 was going to become a worldwide crisis that would impact travel and the ability to go about our daily business. This was a couple weeks before most people understood what was happening. I was was telling family and close friends that they should be ready to cancel their spring plans and be prepared to spend a few weeks at home with no outside contact. I also thought to myself, \"This is going to affect markets. It's going to be a good time to re-balance.\"\n\nAbout a month later, when the market had cratered, I was scrawling mental notes to myself like a bookie. \"Why the f didn't you short airline stocks!? Why didn't you short Carnival? You had this information. Why didn't you sell your portfolio and get back into the market in mid-June, when things will be at their lowest and bleakest?\" It felt very wrong to have stuck with my passive investing plan. \n\nI was reasonably confident that the pandemic would be peaking in intensity right about now and that hospitals would be overwhelmed and the news would be full of images of people dying in high school gymnasiums, right before things started to get better in July.  \n\nEven though I had the insight and special knowledge to time a big market movement, doing it correctly *requires you to be right twice*, not just once. If I had sold a huge chunk of my portfolio in February as I considered, I would have been planning on putting it back into the market in mid June. I would have incurred a large tax bill and then likely bought just about at the same price I sold at. Instead, I held my nose, stuck to my plan and did a little re-balancing and tax loss harvesting. A very rough estimate is that doing \"nothing\" probably earned/saved me 4% of my portfolio value.",

After 10 years it had -55% returns. Ouch. People who were diversified globally, however, did fine *both decades*.\n\nPoint being: if you'd used 2000s results to craft a 2010s portfolio, you'd have done horribly. You certainly wouldn't have tilted toward US growth or tech - you might have left some of that out entirely. And yet here we are, with new people daily asking about tilting toward US large and tech for the 2020s based on the 2010s. I don't know what will do well next. But we do know from prior decades that chasing recent winners can wind up yielding terrible results.\n\nI ask you to *ask yourself*: if you tilt toward US/L/G/Tech and it fails for *ten years*, what will you do? Really think on that. At the end of the day: your investments, your money, your call. I'm just trying to help people avoid mistakes I made, pay it forward to the next generation (in gratitude to those who helped me many years ago). Not sure where to start? Consider a Target Date retirement fund or a baseline of Vanguard Total World + Total Bond. Good luck.\n\n**Update 1:** In the **three months** since I posted this, US large cap growth is up 10% while US small cap value is up two and a half times as much (25%). In fact, small, value and emerging are all ahead of US large, growth and tech. I mention this *not* to recommend chasing these recent winners, but as a reminder that *winners rotate*.\n\n**Update 2:** It's now been **six months** and the spread is even larger. US large caps are up 12% while US small cap value is up 40%. Emerging and developed international each continue to be ahead of US -- *[winners rotate](https://www.reddit.com/r/portfolios/comments/lqy0cy/update_on_us_largegrowthtech_tilt_warning_from_6/).* Per reddit archival norms, it looks like I won't be able to edit this post with further updates for much longer, so: stay the course!\n\n-------------------\n\nP.S. I'm not advising anyone to play the contrarian and buy what isn't doing well, but I *am advising* against tilting toward what has done well recently, because (and I can't type this enough) *winners rotate*. If you want to understand how to invest like a Boglehead, remember that the keys are diversification and staying the course.\n\nP.P.S. Just to head off a common counter-argument from performance-chasers: yes, in theory, if you had bought QQQ and held it while it dropped nearly 80%, then kept investing for 20 years, you'd eventually have come out ahead. Unfortunately, while that sounds simple in hindsight, most investors bail when their stocks drop that far that fast. Notably, too, people are not talking about buying QQQ at a discount right now - rather, it's highest point ever.\n\nP.P.P.S. Some folks are questioning starting and end points of graphs, to which I can only say: ask yourself why you're going to great lengths to justify a point of view - is it logical or emotional? I picked the dates I did because it was easy to look at two back-to-back decades, plus it illustrates winners rotating. If you're dead-set on learning the hard way by riding the rising tide of what's hot now, do what you have to. But there are ways to [learn without banking your hard-earned savings on it](https://www.mymoneyblog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/us_intl_cycle-720x268.gif), and some of those are right there in the sidebar, or among your peers' responses.\n\nP.P.P.P.S. So you're still not convinced - you see those sweet, juicy, tantalizing returns of QQQ or growth or whatever and it's hard to resist. What more can I say? Last decade, growth was down 50%+ while emerging markets were up 200%+. There's always temptation. The key is to cultivate an attitude of buying low and selling high, diversifying and staying the course. Yes, it's less exciting than gambling, but this is your future, not a poker hand. If you're someone who still needs to learn the hard way, so be it - I just hope you learn while the financial stakes are still low for you.",

The people at Wall Street Bets are fine with gambling and so called \"loss porn.\" The real problem is that Robinhood's main source of income is payment for order flow to a company called Citadel.\n\nWhen you place a trade at Robinhood, they send the information to a market maker, most often Citadel. Citadel quickly purchases the security from a seller and then resells it to you. This is why there is a bid ask spread when trading stocks. Citadel serves as a middleman that pockets a few pennies in every transaction.\n\nThe problem is that Citadel is also one of the hedge funds that is shorting GameStop. They stood to lose billions of dollars in a short squeeze tomorrow. When Robinhood blocked the purchase of GME, but not the sale, the stock price tanked. This allowed Citadel to cover their shorts at a tenth of the price they would have had to pay tomorrow. This moved billions of dollars out of the hands of retail speculators into Citadel's accounts (along with a few other hedge funds such as Point72).\n\nRobinhood is beholden to Citadel because most of their revenue comes from them. Fidelity is a private company beholden to its private owners. Schwab is a public company that is beholden to it's public owners. But Vanguard's ownership structure is unique. The fundholders are the owners of Vanguard. As such, they have no conflicts of interest. They don't sell order flow to hedge funds. They don't take the interest out of your cash accounts. They are only accountable to you. I never appreciated this until today.\n\nUltimately, it's one thing to lose your money gambling at a casino.

I just didn't realize it.\n\nWhen I graduated at the tail end of the recession (2009), I asked my dad for advice on how to set up my w2 and he told me to put as much as I could into my 401k. My salary was low because of the recession, but it was respectable. I kept this allocation the same across the several jobs I've had since then. My salary has tripled and I have a lovely wife who just finished her doctorate a few years ago and also puts the max into her 401k. \n\nWhen I logged into my Mint account that I set up after getting my first job, for the first time in a few years, and actually looked at my portfolio, I was shocked to see how much money was in our 401k. It was 5x the money I had just moved into my new brokerage account. It is 3x my annual salary.\n\nSo even though I regret not investing into taxable accounts earlier, and not setting up a roth back then, or even a backdoor roth like my dad told me I should, I realized: I HAVE been investing all this time. I just didn't really think about it. My future looks very secure. And it's thanks to my dad.",

        "selftext": "This is part of what I wrote to him:\n\n\u201cI'm curious to know what you think about index funds and why you believe the portfolio you've structured is a better strategy for me. Index funds also seem to have much lower expense ratios and usually match the market instead of trying to beat it.\nIs there something else I should be considering? What am I missing, index funds are looking like a smart move.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the response. \n\nIn regards to index funds, we do use them (along with ETF\u2019s and stocks) when appropriate and where they fit.  We tend to use those investments when we are looking to drive down the overall cost of the portfolio and where bringing down the overall tax efficiency is important (they tend to get used much more often in non-retirement accounts that retirement ones for that reason).  However, they do serve a valuable purpose.\nWhen looking at the attached report, however, we evaluate numerous different investments and how when they come together, can increase the likelihood of out-performing. \nHence, look at page 4 of the attached report (on the right hand side), where it identifies the \u201calpha\u201d.\nAlpha (\u03b1) is a term used in investing to describe an investment strategy's ability to beat the market, or it's \"edge.\" Alpha is thus also often referred to as \u201cexcess return\u201d or \u201cabnormal rate of return,\u201d.\nThe alpha in this portfolio is 9.78, which identifies the excess return over the benchmark that it was compared to:  Dow Jones Moderately Aggressive TR USD (USD) benchmark.  Therefore, this particular portfolio (for the last 3 years) had an excess return of over 9% when compared to its comparable index.\nFor example, if you look at what happened in the month of January (2021), the Dow Jones was down 2.04%, and the S&amp;P was down 1.01%.  Your large cap growth fund (the JP Morgan Large Cap Growth fund; symbol SEEGX) was up .43% for the month.  Therefore, in our portfolios we tend to blend active WITH passive investing as to achieve maximum alpha while keeping the overall cost of the portfolio down.  However, if you are more comfortable with us using a more passive approach through just index funds and ETF\u2019s, we can certainly do that.\u201d\n\nWhat the heck is he saying? I\u2019ve told him to pause on investing (dollar cost averaging) while I think about how to move forward. I\u2019m still leaning toward having him set up the 3 fund portfolio or just having everything transferred so I can do it. What would you do?",

I've often heard arguments against Bogle's claims that international investing is unnecessary explained as him \"coming from another era.\" While this is of course likely true, there's also the fact that the sole task you have as a passive index investor is to \"stay the course.\" Changing your equity asset allocation after a lifetime of doing it one way because modern economic literature tells you to feels like you are not staying the course.\n\nI started investing in the early 2010s, and at the time I got the entirety of my information from Bogle, Buffet, and later JL Collins' blog. The approach of 100% VTSAX was promoted by countless FIRE bloggers as well and the concept of international investing was seen as an unnecessary complication. While it was difficult to ignore the noise of active trading and other methodologies, I fundamentally trusted this approach to be not only simpler but superior.\n\nNow ten years later everyone is splitting their equities heavily into international. While it makes sense, I want to stress how difficult it is to adopt a new strategy after years and years of pounding the same approach into your head everyday. I imagine the majority of people on this forum are in their mid 20s and have been investing less than five years.

This was foolish. \n\nI ended up losing money and am currently down over $1500 in my taxable account. If I just would have stuck to index funds, I would be fine. I now have less money to pay off my loans. And here's the kicker, I just found out my loans are due in March when I previously thought they were due in September! I timed the market poorly and I will likely have less money to pay off my loans (and the interest will grow). \n\nAnyway, the things I've learned: \n\n1) For every winner, there are many losers. Short term stock picking is very much like gambling. I knew this previously, but this was definitely internalized now. \n\n2) Beyond the money, it's just not worth the time and energy. I don't think people take this into account. Is beating the market worth being stressed out and losing time? I don't think it is. \n\n3) Be aware of FOMO. I thought I wasn't so susceptible to this, but I still fell prey to worrying about other people's gains. \n\n4) Sticking to your plan feels great. I was happy with my previous plan and would have been in a good position to pay off my loans. I know my loss isn't *that* much, but I am more depressed with myself for being so foolish.

        "selftext": "This post is cross-listed on /r/Bogleheads and /r/CanadianInvestor to see if it can generate a wider discussion and perspectives. \n\nUp until recently, I have been investing by contributing to my pension at work. Recently, I have had the excess cash to invest directly myself in a tax sheltered account (TFSA).\n\n\nAccording to one survey, less than 50% of investors rebalance once a year or more, but mostly because it is onerous rather than because it is part of their financial planning. \n\n\n I have been wondering about rebalancing strategies. The following is the summation of my research, and I am interested to hear what others think or have found out?\n\n\n**Sources**: \n\n- Banarjee, P. (2014). [Portfolio Rebalancing: Why, When and How Much](https://www.moneysense.ca/magazine-archive/portfolio-rebalancing-why-when-and-how-much/)\n\n- Vanguard. (2015). [Best Practices for Portfolio Rebalancing.](https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/documents/best-practices-for-portfolio-rebalancing-brief.pdf)\n\n- Wise, A. J. (1996). [The Investment Return from a Portfolio with a Dynamic Rebalancing Policy.](https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/bracjl/v2y1996i04p975-1001_00.html)\n\n**What is rebalancing for?**\n\n- every source agrees, **rebalancing is to minimize risk (volatility) and NOT to maximize returns**\n\n\n**Who Should Rebalance**:\n\n- **SHOULD - anyone who is concerned about volatility**: leveraged investors, investors close to or in retirement, risk-averse investors, short-term investors (planning a purchase or withdrawals in the near term)\n\n- **NOT - those wishing to maximize profits and can stomach the risk**. John Bogle, in a CNBC interview, said he never rebalances because Vanguard\u2019s research showed not rebalancing improved long term annual returns 0.8% (8.1% to 8.9%), but heightened volatility by 3.1% (10.1% to 13.2%). \n\n**The more nuanced answers.**\n\n- **a portfolio of stocks with similar expected returns SHOULD rebalance to maximize returns** - mathematically and statistically the studies showed if you can keep the costs of rebalancing low, rebalancing a stocks only portfolio, on average, performed better than not rebalancing - two possible theories on why were a) it diversifies your portfolio across the least correlated assets and b) most stocks in a similar sectors revert to the mean so captures profits. \n\n- **a portfolio of stocks and bonds (with different expected long-term returns), should NOT rebalance to maximize returns** mathematically and statistically the studies showed rebalancing did reduce volatility, but even though this strategy gives you buying opportunities when stocks fall by selling bonds, the drag from the lower long-term performing bonds outweighs this advantage over the long-term both in terms of median and average returns. \n\n- **a short-term time horizon SHOULD rebalance to maximize returns** - assuming a \u201crandom walk\u201d market price fluctuation, over the short-term rebalancing is both safer, and, on average, produces better median returns (though the average return tends to be lower, due to skew from outlier, very large, stock returns simulations). \n\n- **in a trending market, when prices are consistently moving in one direction (up or down), should NOT rebalance to maximize returns** in his case you are betting against the momentum value factor and on average this causes worse overall returns (identifying a trending market is easy in retrospect, hard to do forward looking).\n\n- **in a mean-reversion market, when prices are \u201cchoppy\u201d (up and down), SHOULD rebalance to maximize returns** in this case, you take advantage of the return to mean. I have seen an interesting Candian Bank ETF that uses this idea to rebalance its 6 bank holdings to good effect. \n\n\n**Other Considerations**: \n\n- taxes (ie/ capital gains) are a consideration when rebalancing depending on your account type\n\n- transaction fees are a consideration depending on your brokerage\n\n- psychology is a factor: a) fear of buying falling assets, b) temptation to market time when rebalancing, c) greed stopping you from realizing gains\n\n\n**When and How Often to Rebalance**:\n\n- **there is no empirical \u201cbest\u201d rebalancing timing.** over different time periods, rebalancing monthly has outperformed, and investing bi-annually has outperformed. From 1926 - 2014, the annual expected return difference between rebalancing monthly, quarterly and annually was 0.4%, with quarterly edging out the other two; from 1968-1991 monthly won out (assuming no costs). \n\n- **rebalancing with new funds did NOT maximize returns but it also did NOT significantly lower returns either, it does lower the number of transactions** again, ignoring costs, investing with dividends and new investment money did significantly lower the number of transactions, but also lowered the return from 1926-2014 to 9.7% (0.1% lower than annually and 0.5% lower than quarterly). Never rebalancing resulted in 13.2% returns (assuming an original 50/50 stocks/bonds investment) and reinvesting dividends. \n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n- if you do NOT hold bonds, there is a good case to be made you SHOULD be rebalancing to maximize returns long-term (according to math and reversion-to-the-mean theories) - rebalancing bi-annually may help you capture the momentum value factor\n\n- if you DO hold bonds, there is a good case to be made you should NOT be rebalancing to maximize returns long-term (according to John Bogle, Vanguard, and math) - short-term rebalancing may help you maintain returns and you must be able to withstand the volatility\n\n- I assume new investments in these studies are purchased at the original allocations of assets, and of course, these studies are averages so results will vary, and they are theoretical, so every investor\u2019s personal situation and asset mix will add tonnes of new variables, and, of course, this is not investing advice just food for thought.",

For example, the likes of s&amp;p 500, VTI, VOO and so on seem pretty consistent to make anywhere from 5-10% year to year.\n\nThanks in advanced!",

        "title": "The 5 stages of acceptance on becoming a Boglehead",
        "selftext": "In a nod to Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, I wanted to document my 5 stages of acceptance to becoming a Bogle believer. Sometimes the mistakes you make are your best teacher - because YOU always know better than anyone else. For those who don't buy the Boglehead philosophy, may your mistakes happen early enough in life that you can recover, see the light, and learn to invest the correct way.\n\nStage 1 - \"I'm great at picking stocks\". I remember getting into stocks in the 1990's courtesy of my mom. She did great and massed a nice portfolio through the years. So I tried to do what she did, but never as well. Dad and I finally figured out she must have a lucky horseshoe implanted somewhere because she would always come home from Vegas with more money that she left with - always. I gave up for 3 years when a stock I researched for 3 years and finally got FDA approval tanked - lost $35,000 - an expensive lesson.\n\nStage 2 - \"OK I can't pick individual stocks, but I can time the market\" So my work 401K had been setup in a target date fund 2035. After 10 years and doing yearly reviews I saw it was really taking off. So I like getting into the weeds, and although the TDF was getting 9-10% returns over the 10 years, my keen eye noted another fund we had a choice to invest in - this T Rowe Price healthcare fund had averaged 19% returns over the past 10 years - and someone at work was invested in this too! \"What genius is this?\" I though - so I \"researched\" for a month before moving 15% of my 401K into that fund. I also learned a lot about my 401K including expense ratios, only having 2 reallocations per month, etc. \n\nStage 3 - \"OK there must be something to broad based fund investing\" OK I was on my way to a healthy retirement savings or so I thought with me at the helm firmly steering my 401K and investments into the best performing fund sectors (stupid me). Luckily I was still doing a lot of reading on the side including reading all the investment reddit forums, as well as listening to 10 audiobooks on the commute to work over 4 months. So thanks to the forums, Jack Bogle, and books (like The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, A Simple Path To Wealth, and The Psychology of Money) for acting like a light house and keeping my ship from wreaking. Thanks to this repetition, it finally sunk thru my thick skull that (1) you can't pick individual stock (2) you also cannot chase market beating returns by performance chasing even if cloaked as a sector ETF or index fund. Sorry Cathy Wood - I better sell that small chunk of ARKG that I bought.\n\nStage 4 - \"I'm a believer in the 3 fund portfolio ... but\" So it took me 4 months to get to this stage. I met with our 401K administrator, I was successful in having my employer's board of directors approve adding VTSAX, VTIAX, and VBTLX to the funds available within our 401K. But like all type A do it yourself people, I needed to understand more. Asset allocation - how much in VTSAX vs VTIAX vs VTBLX? I went thru the \"maybe I can tilt towards small cap valve\" or \"disruptive technologies\" or ..... .  I ran 100 spread sheets looking at what to do after retirement, % of net worth on tax-advantaged accounts vs taxable accounts, impact on safe withdrawal rates, etc. Then factoring in social security, military retirement, etc. AT the end of the day it is simple - save as much as you can, spend less, keep investing as much as you can, don't try to time the market. As an aside I did get very lucky (for once) - I refi'd my house and got the rate locked in at 2.5% - and rates have been rising ever since. Perhaps a little of my mom's luck is rubbing off on me. \n\nStage 5 - \"I have fully accepted the 3 fund portfolio, and have quit looking at my returns - frequently\"  So this is the stage I am in now - I've even stopped looking frequently at my 401K balance (it used to be daily - then weekly. Now not so much). I'm even tweaked my spreadsheets so much there isn't any more tweaking left for my financial plan. I have now moved into the (thankfully) boring part of my financial life - keep buying my 3 low cost index funds every month, keep maxing our Roth IRA and 529 plan, put extra into Vanguard brokerage account, and look at rebalancing maybe every 6 months or when outside my preset bands. \n\nThank you for listening. I figured there are many more people on a similar journey. Maybe this will help them put their knowledge growth into a framework so when they reach the end they know they will \"stay the course\" No matter what.",

        "title": "Young people should take risks with their investments - but the smart way",
        "selftext": "Hello, fellow young people! \n\nWe get a lot of advice saying that young people shouldn't be afraid to take risks with their portfolios. Why is this good advice, and how can you go wrong by taking it?\n\nThe basic answer is that taking a bigger risk entitles you to a greater average reward. There is a \"risk premium\"; a risky investment should always have a higher average return than a safe investment. Thus, if you're willing to take some risks, you should do so and (potentially) reap the rewards.\n\nThis is both correct and incorrect. \n\nWhy is this advice incorrect? Let's take a very simple example. Suppose I tell you that there are currently two companies, A and B, competing in the Gizmo market. As far as we can tell now, they're basically identical. But we know that the industry is so prone to monopolies that a year from now, one company will dominate the market completely, while the other will go bankrupt.\n\nClearly, investing in either company A or company B individually is pretty risky. You have a 50% chance of losing all your money!\n\nOn the other hand, there is a safer strategy: just invest half your money in company A and the other half in company B. In this case, you're guaranteed to hold the company which will eventually dominate the market, even though you'll lose the other half of your money along the way.\n\nWhich strategy has a higher average reward: investing only in company A, or splitting your money 50/50 between A and B? It turns out that mathematically, the two strategies have exactly the same mean return!\n\nSo if you decided to invest all your money in company A because it's a risky strategy and risky strategies get higher average rewards, you'd be making a serious logical error.\n\nThere are some kinds of risks that don't result in higher average returns. Any risk that you can avoid without lowering your average returns is a risk which doesn't compensate you with higher average returns. These risks include:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The risk of buying an individual stock, preferring one company over its direct, equally-risky competitors\n2. The risk of buying stocks in only one country, rather than across a range of equally-risky countries\n3. The risk of trusting a money manager to beat an index, rather than investing in a range of equally-risky money managers\n4. The risk of only buying stocks found on the NASDAQ exchange, rather than also purchasing their direct competitors on the NYSE (looking at you, QQQ)\n5. The risk of buying companies in only one industry, rather than buying stocks in multiple equally-risky industries\n\nOn the other hand, there are risks that you can't eliminate through diversification without sacrificing average reward. For example, there is a systematic risk that stocks, as a whole, will do dramatically worse than US treasuries over the next 5 years. Stocks are systematically riskier than bonds. This fact is why stocks have higher average returns than bonds.\n\nSo how can young investors sensibly take risks? The first way would be to invest 100% in a diversified portfolio of stocks. Thankfully, Vanguard makes it really easy to achieve broad diversification throughout the whole world by purchasing a single ETF/mutual fund: VT/VTWAX.\n\nIf you want to go further than that, you can try to find parts of the stock market which are systematically riskier than the stock market as a whole, just as the stock market as a whole is systematically riskier than the combined stock-bond market, and begin overweighting these parts of your portfolio.\n\nSome examples of riskier subsections of the market include emerging markets, small-cap stocks, and value stocks. There is significant evidence in the academic literature that these categories are systematically riskier than the market as a whole and receive, in the long term, higher average returns to compensate.\n\nTo summarize: there are good ways of taking risks (which lead to greater average returns), and there are bad ways of taking risks (stock picking, actively managed funds, etc).\n\nWhy should young people take risks?\n\nFirst of all, many risks are mostly risks in the short term. A 10 year treasury bond is riskier in the short term than a 2 month bond because the 10 year bond can fluctuate more wildly in value when interest rates change. But over the course of 30 years, you're almost certainly better off with 10 year bonds than with 2 month bonds. Having a long-term time horizon means you can take advantage of this fact.\n\nSecondly, having a long time horizon means the \"law of large numbers\" works in your favor. The longer the time horizon, the more important average returns are and the less important short-term variation is. \n\nFinally, young people have only invested a small fraction of the amount of money they will put into the markets over their entire lives. If you're going to invest $100 total in the market $1 at a time, it's not a very big risk to lose the 1st dollar entirely. It is a big risk to lose all $100 once everything is invested.\n\nSo take risks! But do so only in ways that actually benefit you on average. After all, if the market is willing to compensate you for some kinds of risk, why take risks that you get paid nothing for?",

        "selftext": "# Hello reddit boglehead noobs\n\nIf you are just starting out your investing journey, congratulations! We're happy you're here.\n\nI often see this question from my friends IRL, so I thought I'd share a quick primer on why exactly do we invest in stocks? Why not gold, or bitcoin, or oil? Why not just hide it under the mattress? What about stocks make them an *investment* rather than a mere vehicle for *speculation*?\n\nI promise there will be pictures.\n\nBy owning an index fund like VTWAX, you are buying a small slice of ownership of thousands of companies, all over the world. These companies have revenues, expenses, and profits. By owning a company's stock, you hold a stake of ownership in that company, and you do so because you expect to benefit from the profits. Companies reward investors with their profits through dividend payments and share price growth.\n\nMany of my friends admit they realize the market is always unpredictable, but I cannot tell you how many times I\u2019ve had the following exchange:\n\nFriend:\u00a0 9c6, what is your outlook on the market?\n\nMe:\u00a0 No one can predict the market and any guess I have would be just that, a guess, and the same odds as a coin flip.\u00a0 Therefore you shouldn\u2019t value my prediction.\n\nFriend:\u00a0 I know I know\u2026\u2026\u2026but what do you think?\n\nMy thoughts are that over the very long haul, the return of the stock market is driven by a fairly simple equation, starting dividend yield + earnings per share growth +/- change in the earnings multiple.\u00a0 The earnings multiple is commonly referred to as the p/e ratio.\n\n# Fundamental Return = Earnings Growth + Dividend Yield\n\n**Part 1: Dividend Yield**  \nIf your stock distributes 2% in dividends each year, then you will have a 2% contribution towards of return. This is what dividend investors love to see coming in each quarter, and is relatively easy to track for a large group of companies. Here it is over time for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/c7d8jh2wj8p61.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 2: Earnings Growth**  \nIf earnings stay constant, then all other things equal, one would expect the share price of your company to stay constant as well. If the earnings grow by 5% every year, then your share price will grow by 5% per year. Thus, earnings growth rate is a vital component of total return.\n\nIf your portfolio was all of the stocks traded in the United States, like that of a broad-based index fund, this would create a connection between the growth rate of the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product and the earnings growth rates of all US companies. In other words, the fundamental return is based on GDP growth. In turn, the GDP growth rate is connected to population growth and productivity per person.\n\nThese two parts added to together are coined the fundamental return.\n\nSome bad news: Now, from 1950-2000, fundamental returns were 10%: 4% dividend yield and a 6% earnings growth rate. These days, the S&amp;P 500 has a dividend yield of only about 2%. Earnings growth rate estimates are subject to debate, but they hover around 5-6%.\n\n**Part 3: Changes in P/E Ratio**\n\nBut that's not the whole story, as we should know by looking at the stock market. Why don't stock prices simply reflect the fundamentals? The answer is the speculative component.\n\n  \nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is the price per share divided by earnings per share. In other words, it is how much investors are willing to pay for each unit of earnings. If they are willing to pay 20 times annual earnings, the share price of the stock will be twice as high as if they only paid 10 times earnings. This part is denoted the **speculative return**, as it has changed throughout history. Here it is again for the S&amp;P 500:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1h3fm9bxm8p61.gif\n\n# \n\nIn 1950, the P/E ratio was less than 10. During the dot-com bubble, the P/E ratio was over 40. In 2008, it was over 25. In mid-2010, it was 20. Today, it's around 35. The historical average is around 15. This will lead to a zero, and quite possible *negative*, future speculative return!\n\n# Total Stock Returns = Fundamental + Speculative Returns\n\nThe below table is from John Bogle\u2019s book \u201cThe Clash of the Cultures:\u00a0 Investment vs. Speculation\u201d.\u00a0 Bogle refers to the change in the p/e ratio as the speculative return.\u00a0 What you see on the far right column is that over the full period earnings growth and dividends contributed 9.50% of the annual 9.60% return, while the change in the p/e ratio only contributed 0.10%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6qkn1g0hh8p61.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5cffc0d5b2b6e9894c3ddc072f323428ccd9e7e\n\nThe 40s had the largest combination of earnings growth + dividends of any decade, but there were 3 other decades with higher total returns.\u00a0 You can imagine that coming out of The Great Depression, there was a whole generation of people who had shun stocks for the rest of their lives, and the speculative return was largely negative.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating that earnings growth in the 2000s decade was 11.30% better annually than the earnings growth in the 1930s, and the market return during the decade of the 2000s was worse than the decade of the Great Depression!\n\nOver the course of a lifetime, I would not anticipate the speculative change of the earnings multiple to add or subtract much from returns.\u00a0 If you\u2019re trying to predict the next 30 years from here I would guesstimate about 7% a year from the market.\u00a0 The current dividend yield is about 2%, and if earnings grow at the historical rate of 5% you\u2019ll add those together for 7%.\u00a0 But as you can see, the formula doesn\u2019t work very well in the short run.\n\n## Summary\n\nWhen predicting future returns, you have to look at all the sources of those expected returns. Fundamental return is still a solid reason why stock prices will go up on the long-term, especially if you are not investing only in one country or economy. Some people call it a belief in capitalism, that economic growth will continue and GDP will continue to increase. I simply believe in the passion and motivation of all the people out there, from Sweden to China to Brazil. However, there is good evidence that you might not be getting 10% historical returns due to P/E ratio contraction.\n\nWhat does the future hold for returns? It's anyone's guess.

Hitch your boat to the global economy and a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. In the long run, the speculative component is a wash, and you'll reap the benefits of the passion and ingenuity of businesses the world over.\n\nVTWAX to the moon! \ud83d\ude80\n\nMake a plan, stick to it, and stay the course. \u26f5\ufe0f",

It makes an interesting point:\r\n\r\n* \"It\u2019s a classic case of enduring short-term pain for long-term gain. In fact, long-term investors in bonds should welcome higher rates. As a rule of thumb, if rates rise today, and *your time horizon is longer than the duration of your bond holdings*, you may be better off in the long term.\"\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s how I understand this. Say you buy a 5-year bond fund at a time when yields rise. The bond price drops, but your monthly interest will go up as the fund replaces its holdings with new, high-yielding bonds. Eventually you'll reach a point at which you recoup the price loss - this occurs at 5 years (the bond duration). So in general, it's a good idea to match your bond duration to the time at which you expect to cash out. \r\n\r\n(A caveat to this is unexpected inflation, which you can get around with TIPS/I-bonds.)\r\n\r\nThe article concludes: \r\n\r\n* \"When it comes to navigating uncertain times, stick with your game plan, ignore the noise, and remember the long-term outcomes.\"",

But do you guys think this is even realistic? To me it seems completely off and people end up with way higher expectations than they should, am I wrong?\n\nI am talking about index investing in the whole world market + emerging. \n\nFor example [here](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/890dd84d-3750-4656-87f2-1229ed5a5d6e) are the returns of the MSCI World, MSCI Emerging and MSCI ACWI (which combines both I believe). You can see the last 21 years = 4.8% a year. And that doesn't even account for inflation. If you take that into account you would have returns of what? Like 3% ? That is magnitudes different than 8%....\n\nI know past performance doesn't predict future performance, but wouldn't it be more reasonable to expect 3% returns rather than 8%?\n\nI'm not saying that one should do stock picking or go full Nasdaq, or chase performance, I'm just thinking that people are expecting too much out of investing in the stock market in general. \n\nAgain, this is not coming from someone who claims to be an expert. I am looking to understand what's going on. I actually hope to be wrong. Because investing 10k at 3% would only give me a profit of 8K after 20 years....nothing to rave about... at that point I'd rather invest in real estate.",

        "selftext": "I'm a middle aged dude which makes me a very old head on this sub.  One thing that strikes me is that the vast majority of posts are about how to invest.  \"What should I do with $5,000\" and the like.  For the younger folk just starting their careers, who make up the vast majority of this sub, those investment questions are relatively unimportant.  Whether you put $5,000 in VT or put it in some actively managed mutual fund is not going to make a ton of difference in 40 years.  20 years from now, when you've got a million dollars, how you should invest it becomes a very salient question.  But the only way to get to a million dollars in 20 years is to save a ton.  So where are the questions on that?\n\nDo you guys think you've got it figured out?  Or you're not sure what to ask?\n\nOr maybe you don't think this is the place to ask?  It is!  The Boglehead philosophy is about more than investing.  It's really around accumulating enough money to achieve your financial goals, and saving is the most important of that.  So questions about how to increase your income and/or decrease your expenses are fair game.\n\nOperators are standing by.  I'm ready to lend my (limited) wisdom on the subject, and I think you can get a lot of great ideas here from your own age cohort too.  So let's have them!\n\nEdit: A few salient points have been brought up in the comments that I thought I'd address.\n\n1. **There are other subs for that**.  This is a great point and like an idiot I hadn't even considered it.  I guess the question is whether r/Bogleheads is just a place to discuss asset location and allocation and other subs are for discussing other parts of personal finance *or* whether r/Bogleheads is a community of like-minded people who can elevate the quality of discussion for all personal finance matters.\n2. **I can't believe you're saying it doesn't matter whether you invest in index funds or actively managed funds.**  I want to be very clear that I am not saying that.  What I *am* saying is that for a one-time investment of $5,000, it's not going to make a huge difference whether your expense ratio is 1% or 0.1% because $5,000 just isn't enough money.  Obviously getting in the habit of investing in diversified index funds is an awesome thing and will pay dividends in the long run *if* you are able to save enough money to make it meaningful.  The biggest opportunity you have to make a meaningful difference in your earning ability is when you're young.  This sub's demos are perfect for those kinds of discussions.\n3. **Just telling people to spend less is tired advice.** When I say save more, I don't mean spend less.  I mean some combination of spend less and earn more.  For most young people, earning more is generally a much more effective strategy.\n4. **Telling people to earn more is also tired advice.** I agree that telling someone to earn more and leaving it at that is tired advice.  I'm interested in having in-depth discussions about HOW to earn more.  Specific strategies for people with specific situations.\n\nI thought it also might be useful to tell my own life story and highlight the good and bad decisions I made throughout.  So here goes.\n\nI was a bright kid and got into my state's excellent flagship university in the mid 90s.  I also got into another state's excellent flagship university.  I almost went to the out-of-state university but came to my senses at the last minute and went to the in-state university.  I have no idea what I was thinking when I was considering the out-of-state school or why my parents were going to let an 18 year old make such an important decision.\n\nWhen I was a freshman, I considered majoring in computer science.  I took a couple of courses and decided I absolutely hated it.  Obviously computer science would've been a lucrative major, but I think I made the right decision not going into something I loathed.  On the other hand, I ended up majoring in history which was just dumb.  I have a good head for business and finance--I should have either majored in business (if I could've gotten into the undergrad biz school, which is dubious) or economics.  Some folks think college is a place to explore your passions, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but I also think people need to view it as a career stepping stone.\n\nPursuant to this idea that I wasn't thinking about my career when I was in college, I didn't get any Summer jobs.  No internships.  Never once talked to the career office.  What the hell was I thinking?  I took classes during the Summer instead and graduated in 3 years.  With no job prospects.  I ended up moving back in with my mom and lazing around the house for 6 months before a family friend hired me to do some crappy entry level job for $10 an hour.\n\nI got promoted at the company to a slightly less crappy job and by puffing up that experience as much as possible on my application, combined with good grades and an excellent GMAT, I was able to get into exactly 1 of the 4 top MBA programs I applied to.  This was my big break in life.  If that fourth school had rejected me as well, I don't know how it would've turned out.  I mean, I would've kept applying every year, but my job experience was really crummy.  I got lucky in a big way.\n\nI got a job out of biz school at a megacompany doing marketing and general management.  My pre-MBA salary was $32,000 a year.  My post-MBA salary was $78,000 a year.  This changed everything.  I went from living paycheck to paycheck to saving oodles of money.  I was able to get promoted a couple of times at my new company and by my mid 30s I was making \\~$200,000 in total compensation.  In my mind, I was really not that frugal during this time period.  But compared to my high earning friends, I definitely was.  So I saved a ton of money over a 12 year career and invested it religiously.  At the end of the 12 years, I had about a million dollars.\n\nPart way through that 12 year career, I discovered [Bogleheads.org](https://Bogleheads.org) and adjusted my investment strategy accordingly.  This was a positive change though I'm not sure it made a huge difference in my money situation since I think I was just dumping the money into target retirement funds before that so was doing just fine.\n\nI am a smart guy and was decent at my job, but I can also be hard-headed.  I was never what one would call a \"boss pleaser.\"  I felt like my duty was to the shareholders, not my boss.  This is a terribly impractical and losing career strategy and I would not recommend it to anyone.  Please your boss!!!  I also didn't work as hard as some of my peers.  Eventually, I was laid off.\n\nFortunately, I had started up a side hustle about 3 years before being laid off.  It was still pretty small-time, but I was ready to give it a go because I hated corporate America and I had enough of a financial cushion to try it out.  It's worked out!  I make WAY less than I used to, but I've also cut expenses.  I'm not the kind of person who is interested in \"things,\" so that helps.  I have tons of flexibility and travel the world a ton.  I can work wherever I have my laptop.  I work a lot less than I did in corporate America, too.  In the beginning, I was taking out maybe 2% per year from my nest egg per year to cover the shortfall between my income and my expenses, but I'm now at the point where my income covers my expenses fully.  I don't have a family to support which helps tremendously.  I've got somewhere in the range of \\~$1.5M in assets and have it invested 75% stocks/25% bonds.  I'm at the point where I'm cruising along and letting the market do the hard work of growing my money while I just need to make enough money to cover my expenses and enjoy life.  It's a really good place to be.\n\nSo anyway, that's my story.  Maybe there are some parts of it that would inspire somebody to ask a question to help them in their own life?",

Thanks to you guys, I have maxed out my Roth IRA twice with total market index funds, and have a few thousand in a brokerage account invested in them as well.\n\nTo quote Rick Ferri, one among many that I look up to:\n\nThe four stages of successfully index fund investing:\nStage 1: Darkness (know nothing about nothing)\nStage 2: enlightenment (discovered that you're better off not trying to beat the market)\nStage 3: Overcomplicate everything (trying to beat the market WITH index funds).\nState 4: Simplicity - own the total market and move on with life\n\nI can certainly relate to these stages. While I knew some things about investing before coming in (my money was in a mutual fund that underperformed the index from the age of 13 to 17 in a custodial account) I did not know that index investing was a thing. Eventually I found some speeches by J.L. Collins and Jack Bogle that peaked my interest in index investing, leading me to join this forum. I had been enlightened.\n\nThen, I learned about factor investing. Oh boy. I was trying to figure out ways to increase my return over the long run by adding Emerging Markets, Small Cap Value, etc. I went down the rabbit hole and was at a point where I was truly trying to beat the index in an almost active management kind of way. At this point, I realized that what I was doing was not what I had in mind when I was in the enlightenment phase. I was violating the first principle of indexing, which is that over the long run, the chances that any investor or fund manager will consistently outperform the market are slim. By then, I had read every small cap value and slice and dice debate here to exhaustion. I eventually came to the realization that I was OK with total market returns and that tinkering was not only unnecessary, but that I would likely end up doing something stupid like changing my strategy because I found one that is more optimized or abandoning it all together if it were to underperform the market. Whereas before I thought that I could handle a part of my portfolio underperforming the market for 20 years, I realized that in reality I would likely not be able to. 20 years is longer than I have been alive.\u00a0\n\nI had done it. I had reached the phase of Simplicity. By reading some of the stories on this forum, this has taken some people years or even decades to achieve, and I could not have done it without all of you. I feel blessed. Thank you all. R.I.P Jack Bogle.\n\nTLDR: Thanks",

You can only buy upto $10,000 of Series-I savings bonds per year per person. You can also request an additional up to 5K with your tax returns.\n\nTax implications:\n\n1.

        "selftext": "\\*Long post warning\\*\n\nPrologue:\n\nI  went to school for accounting/business in the mid to late 2000s and became a CPA after. While I  took finance classes in university, the idea of investing didn't really dawn on me (which is stupid considering that I have a financial  background. As I finished my schooling in the early 2010s in my early  20s, I was buying and selling a certain large cap company on advice of my father because it had a great dividend and it was a safe company that a lot of everyone use in their day to day life but sometime around 2010-2013  ish (don't remember the specifics), he said don't buy anything because  it's really overpriced and the market will come crashing down at any moment. He said he had lost a lot of money on Black Monday in '87 and he  didn't want me to lose all my money. So I didn't invest it and put it  into a money market fund, waiting for the right time to buy. Every time I  asked, he would say \"it's way too high\". Little did we know that from 2008 would be the one of the biggest bull markets in history.\n\nEventually,  I realized that he is the type of guy who thinks things should always  cost $20 but really they cost $50 these days or simply put, he's stuck in the 1980s/1990s. It was the same thing when  my wife and I bought our first house a few years ago. He said don't offer anything above asking price (out of the corner of my eye, I saw our real estate agent smirking because she knew the market), we  eventually went about 7% over asking but we are happy with our house. My dad has been a general dentist for 40 years, so he is wealthy (not obnoxiously so but more than enough) so I think he doesn't realize what's it's like to be starting out or how cautious he can be because of his wealth.\n\nSo right now, I have not invested my money in anything for 8-10 years and boy I have been  kicking myself for it. I am not going to abuse hindsight to say I would have  bought all the BTCs or TSLA I could have but even just a simple index  fund would have done okay.\n\nMy  wife's story is much simpler but just as frustrating (married 3 years ago for context). She was not interested in investing at all or really financially illiterate so her father did all the investing.  Unfortunately, he only put her money in GICs because it was drilled into  him by his parents that if you invest in the stock market, you will lose everything. So he faithfully followed that advice.\n\nMy-in laws are farmers who plead poverty but are not poverish. Back 20+ years  ago, GICs were okay but now GICs are worth nothing. They could have put their money into safe dividend securities and doubled their money at  least. It just pains me to see what fear and general ignorance does to people. But to be honest, my father-in-law would probably check the stocks all day and see that they are going down and panic sell. It's not too late for them to invest but I don't think I can change their mindset.\n\nMy  wife used to be like her parents when we first got married. \"We could  lose everything!\" was her usual comment about investing to which my first response would be \"if all of the stock market goes to zero, we have a lot bigger problems\" and then my 2nd response would be \"where do you think your job pension comes from?\" but now she's stating to understand why it's important and how it's safer then it appears, plus she doesn't want to do real estate investing to become a landlord.\n\nThe interesting thing is that both of our fathers weren't wrong, it's just they weren't right in their assessment/methodology (with some hindsight of course). Warren Buffett made a great point once of living in  \"uncertain times\", he said that September 10, 2001 was an uncertain time, you just didn't know it yet. Also, the biggest lesson is \"Time in the market is better than timing the market\" and now we are looking at invest when everything is at an all time high.\n\nCurrent - How I Stopped Worrying and Started to look at Index Funds (plus commentary on today):\n\nI started my proper investing journey by reading The Intelligent Investor and I found some of it to be useful (the bits about buying bonds and cigar buds, not so much). I have also watched and read from Warren Buffett/Peter Lynch/Jack Bogle and all of them say \"for the average person, just do an index fund\". These are some of the most successful people giving our free advice. Buffett went so far as to post the results of a bet of his where he put the S&amp;P Index against a group of hedge funds and in the end, S&amp;P kicked ass compared to what the hedge funds did. The more I researched, the more it makes sense because our lives are so busy and there's too many rabbit holes out there to be sucked into or just meme stocks in general. Plus we don't really need dividends right now, only growth. The index fund should work for my wife because even though she's a risk adverse person, the \"set it and forget it\" should appeal to her. \n\nIt amazes me how many people don't follow the index advice, maybe it's because it's too boring for them. \"Know what you own\" is the one of the biggest pieces of advice that I got from reading/watching and I don't know if a lot of people (at least on reddit) actually do - aka this DOGECOIN bs. To me, right now, the stock market is filled with degenerate gamblers (TO THE MOON!!!!!!!!). \n\nThe hardest part of the index strategy is FOMO, and it's real. Not necessarily from GME/etc but other things in general. The index fund method is meant for average people and not meant to get rich quick or even get rich from being a smart investor (Mark Cuban once said that diversification is for idiots and concentration is how you build wealth (at least initially)). There could be undervalued stocks out there but in the age of information and technology that we live in, I think a lot of those sorts of secrets aren't staying secrets for long. \n\nIn the end, I think we will go with a 100 % with Vanguard Index Fund where it's 80% equities and 20% bonds, starting with a lump sum and then DCA as we are able to afford it. It's a little uncomfortable that we are investing when everything is at all time highs but we have 30-35 more years to go so in theory, coupled with DCA, it shouldn't matter. I might allow myself maybe 5-10% of the portfolio as \"play money\" but nothing more than that. \n\nThank you for reading and I look forward to your insight.",

        "selftext": "[http://efficientfrontier.com/ef/0adhoc/ifyoucan.pdf](http://efficientfrontier.com/ef/0adhoc/ifyoucan.pdf)\n\nIf You Can\n\nHow Millennials Can Get Rich Slowly\n\nWilliam J. Bernstein \u00a92014\n\nWould you believe me if I told you that there\u2019s an investment strategy that a seven-year-old could understand, will take you fifteen minutes of work per year, outperform 90 percent of finance professionals in the long run, and make you a millionaire over time?\n\nWell, it is true, and here it is: Start by saving 15 percent of your salary at age 25 into a 401(k) plan, an IRA, or a taxable account (or all three). Put equal amounts of that 15 percent into just three different mutual funds:\n\n* A U.S. total stock market index fund\n* An international total stock market index fund\n* A U.S. total bond market index fund.  \nOver time, the three funds will grow at different rates, so once per year you\u2019ll adjust their amounts so that they\u2019re again equal. (That\u2019s the fifteen minutes per year, assuming you\u2019ve enrolled in an automatic savings plan.)  \nThat\u2019s it; *if* you can follow this simple recipe throughout your working career, you will almost certainly beat out most professional investors. More importantly, you\u2019ll likely accumulate enough savings to retire comfortably.  \n**But You\u2019re Still Screwed**  \nMost young people believe that Social Security won\u2019t be there for them when they retire, and that this is a major reason why their retirements will not be as comfortable as their parents\u2019. Rest assured that you *will* get Social Security; its imbalances are relatively minor and fixable, and even if nothing is done, which is highly unlikely in view of the program\u2019s popularity, you\u2019ll still get around three-quarters of your promised benefit.  \nThe *real* reason why you\u2019re going to have a crummy retirement is that the conventional \u201cdefined benefit\u201d pension plan of your parents\u2019 generation, which provided a steady and reliable stream of income for as long as they lived, has gone the way of disco. There\u2019s only one person who can repair the gap left by the disappearance of these plans, and you know who that is. Unless you act with purpose and vigor, your retirement options may well range between moving in with your kids and sleeping under a bridge in the rain.  \nFurther, the most important word in this entire booklet is the  \n***if***  \nin the above \u201cif you can follow this simple recipe,\u201d because, you see, it\u2019s a very, very big *if*.  \nAt first blush, consistently saving 15 percent of your income into three index funds seems easy, but saying that you can become comfortably well-to-do and retire successfully by doing so is the same as saying that you\u2019ll get trim and fit by eating less and exercising more. People get fat because they like pizza more than fresh fruit and vegetables and would rather watch Monday night football than go to the gym or jog a few miles. Dieting and investing are both *simple*, but neither is *easy.* (And I should know, since I\u2019ve been much more successful at the latter than at the former.)\n\nIn your parents\u2019 day, the traditional pension plan took care of all the hard work and discipline of saving and investing, but in its absence, this responsibility falls on your shoulders. In effect, the traditional pension plan was an investing fat farm that involuntarily limited calorie intake and made participants run five miles per day. Too bad that, except for the luckiest workers, such as corporate executives and military personnel, these plans are disappearing.\n\nBad things almost inevitably happen to people who try to save and invest for retirement on their own, and if you\u2019re going to succeed, you\u2019re going to need to avoid them. To be precise, five bad things\u2014 hurdles, if you will\u2014must be overcome if you are to succeed and retire successfully:\n\n**Hurdle number one:** People spend too much money. They decide that they need the newest iPhone, the most fashionable clothes, the fanciest car, or a Cancun vacation. Say you\u2019re earning $50,000 per year, 15 percent of which is $7,500, or $625 per month. In this day and age, that\u2019s a painfully thin margin of saving, and it can be wiped out simply by stringing together several seemingly innocent expenditures, each of which might nick your savings by $100 or so per month: a latte per day, a too- rich cable package, an apartment that\u2019s a little too tony, a dress or pair of brand-name sneakers you really don\u2019t need, a few unnecessary restaurant meals and, yes, an excessive smart phone plan you could, if you had to, not only live without, but also function better without. Life without these may seem spartan, but it doesn\u2019t compare to being old and poor, which is where you\u2019re headed if you can\u2019t save. You might even save the whole $625 in one fell swoop just by living with a roommate for a while longer, instead of renting your very own place. Again, as bad as having a roomie may be, it\u2019s not nearly as awful as living on cat food at age 70.\n\nLet\u2019s assume you *can* save enough. You\u2019re not home free, not by a long shot. You\u2019ve got four more barriers to get by.\n\n**Hurdle number two:** You\u2019ll need an adequate understanding of what finance is all about. Trying to save and invest without a working knowledge of the theory and practice of finance is like learning to fly without grasping the basics of aerodynamics, engine systems, meteorology, and aeronautical risk management. It\u2019s possible, but I don\u2019t recommend it. I\u2019m not suggesting that you need to get an MBA or even read a big, dull finance textbook. The essence of scientific finance, in fact, is remarkably simple and can be acquired, if you know where to look, pretty easily. (And rest assured, I\u2019ll tell you exactly where to find it.)\n\n**Hurdle number three:** Learning the basics of financial and market *history*. This is not quite the same as the above hurdle; if learning about the theory and practice of finance is akin to studying aeronautics, then studying investing history is akin to reading aircraft accident reports\u2014something every conscientious pilot does. The new investor is usually disoriented and confused by market turbulence and the economic crises that often cause it; this is because he or she does not realize that there\u2019s nothing really new under the investment sun. A quote often misattributed to Mark Twain has it that \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.\u201d This fits finance to a tee. If you don\u2019t recognize the landscape, you *will* get lost. Contrariwise, there\u2019s nothing more reassuring than being able to say to yourself, \u201cI\u2019ve seen this movie before (or at least I\u2019ve read the script), and I know how it ends.\u201d\n\n**Hurdle number four:** Overcoming your biggest enemy\u2014the face in the mirror\u2014is a daunting task. Know thyself. Human beings are simply not designed to manage long-term risks. Over hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution, and over hundreds of millions of years of animal development, we\u2019ve evolved to think about risk as a short-term phenomenon: the hiss of the snake, the flash of black\n\nand yellow stripes in the peripheral vision. We were certainly *not* designed to think about financial risk over its proper time horizon, which is several decades. Know that from time to time you *will* lose large amounts of money in the stock market, but these are usually short-term events\u2014the financial equivalent of the snake and the tiger. The *real* risk you face is that you\u2019ll be flattened by modern life\u2019s financial elephant: the failure to maintain strict long-term discipline in saving and investing.\n\n**Hurdle number five:** As an investor, you must recognize the monsters that populate the financial industry. They\u2019re very talented chameleons; they don\u2019t *look* like monsters; rather, they appear in the guise of a cousin or an old college friend. They are also self-deluded monsters; most \u201cfinance professionals\u201d don\u2019t even realize that they\u2019re moral cripples, since in order to function they\u2019ve had to tell themselves a story about how they\u2019re really helping their customers. But even if they\u2019re able to fool others and often themselves as well, make sure they don\u2019t fool you.\n\nOnly if you can clear all five of these hurdles can you successfully execute the deceptively simple \u201cthree fund strategy\u201d I\u2019ve outlined above.\n\nHow can you defeat these five demons? No financial expert, no matter how smart, or how well he or she writes, can tell you exactly how to do this within a few dozen pages of a booklet like this. To torture a metaphor, I can show you the road to Jerusalem, but since the journey takes longer than I have within these relatively few pages, I can\u2019t take you all the way there.\n\nIn other words, this inexpensive, small booklet is not a taxi cab or an airliner; it\u2019s a map.\n\nAcquiring the tools to make you a competent investor will take you at least several months. You can\u2019t learn to pilot an airplane in an hour, which is all it\u2019ll take for you to finish this booklet, and neither can you become a competent investor in an hour either. The good news is that you\u2019re young and in no particular hurry, and that the effort of following the road map will be time well spent.\n\nNow, for full disclosure. First, I\u2019ve written a few investment books that continue to earn me royalties. I don\u2019t want you to buy them, since it\u2019s tacky for an author to recommend the purchase of his or her works. I\u2019ll shortly tell you what other books you should read, and in what order. Second, I\u2019m also a co- principal in a money management firm. My partner and I specialize in individuals who already have millions; you very well might get there, but I\u2019m old enough that by the time you do, I\u2019ll be pushing up the daisies. I am writing this book for my children, my grandchildren, and for the millions of young people who don\u2019t have a prayer of retiring successfully unless they take control of their saving and investing.\n\n**How to read this booklet**\n\nThis is, as you can see, a very short booklet and although it will take you very little time to read, you\u2019re going to have to read it twice, and the second time will take a while if you do it properly.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve completed this booklet, about an hour from now, take another ten minutes and reread the next section, beginning with \u201cHurdle Number One.\u201d At the end of that section, you\u2019ll encounter your first reading assignment, which will take you at least a week or two. If you have a busy schedule, it may even take you a month or two.\n\nThen reread the following section, and then complete *its* reading assignment, which again will take you a few weeks or months. And so on, through to the end of the booklet.\n\nThis may take you up to a year, but you\u2019re in no hurry, since you are just beginning to think about your retirement and you likely have little in the way of assets; you may even be in hock up to your ears with debts from school and car loans. So there\u2019s plenty of time, and the months you take to complete the course laid out in the booklet will be the most profitable reading you will ever do; it may not be too much of an exaggeration to suggest, in fact, that your financial life depends on it.\n\nWith that out of the way, let\u2019s get started.\n\n**Hurdle Number One: Even if you can invest like Warren Buffett, if you can\u2019t save, you\u2019ll die poor.**\n\nHow much do you need to save? We\u2019ll get into deeper math in the next section, but, as already mentioned, if you\u2019re starting to save at age 25 and want to retire at 65, you\u2019ll need to put away at least 15% of your salary.\n\nBefore you can save, you\u2019ll of course have to get yourself out of debt. In thinking about just how to do this, it helps to compare your expected investment return with the interest you\u2019re paying on your debt.\n\nEvery situation is different, but a few basic principles apply to everyone. First, no matter how much debt you have, always, always max out the employer match on your 401(k), 403, or other defined contribution retirement plan, since the \u201creturn\u201d on this money is usually between 50% and 100%, which is higher than even the worst credit card interest rates. (From now on, I\u2019ll use the term \u201c401(k)\u201d to refer to any employer-sponsored deferred compensation plan.)\n\nNext, eliminate your credit card debt, followed by your car loan. What about your educational loans? Since your long-term investment return on your retirement savings will be around 5%, which is likely lower than your loan interest rate, you should make paying off those your next priority. When, and only when, you\u2019ve gotten rid of all your debt are you truly saving for retirement.\n\nThe above paragraph raises a subtle but important point about retirement savings. Note that I quoted an \u201cexpected return\u201d of 5% for your retirement saving. We\u2019ll skip over for now how I arrived at that figure, but for the moment, I\u2019ll point out that this 5% number is *not* adjusted for inflation; that is, it is a \u201cnominal\u201d rate of return. I did this so as to more accurately compare it to the loan and credit card interest rates you may be facing.\n\nFor the purposes of retirement savings, though, it\u2019s better to think about returns that have been adjusted for inflation, that is, \u201creal\u201d rates. Currently, for example, long-term inflation appears to be running at around 2%, so the above 5% expected *nominal* return of your investments calculates out to a 3% *real* return, and what matters is the spending power of your portfolio, that is, its *real* value, not the *nominal* value you\u2019ll see on your brokerage or mutual fund statements. From now on, we\u2019re only going to talk about real returns and dollar amounts, not nominal returns and dollar amounts; every time you see a dollar figure, you\u2019ll have to remember that this is in terms of spending power in the year 2014. One final point: this means that in the above example, planning on saving $625 per month beginning in 2014 means you\u2019ll have to increase that savings amount with inflation; this should not be difficult, since you can expect that your salary should increase by at least that rate.\n\nI\u2019ll end this section, as I mentioned above, with a reading assignment: Thomas Stanley and William\n\nDanko\u2019s *The Millionaire Next Door.* This is the most important book you\u2019ll ever read, because it emphasizes the point that there\u2019s an inverse correlation between spending and saving. (Statisticians and economists like to pooh-pooh this book for its methodological flaws, which admittedly are many. These blemishes, though, in no way detract from the lucid way in which *Millionaire* dissects the corrosive effects of our consumer-oriented society on both personal and societal well being.)\n\nMy father was a modestly successful attorney who, because he began his career a few years before the onset of the Depression, became a compulsive saver. Consequently, our house, vacations, and automobiles were not as fancy as those of our neighbors. When I\u2019d ask him why this was, he\u2019d reply that our neighbors *owned* a lot, but didn\u2019t *have* a lot. In fact, he\u2019d slyly add, he knew for a fact that more than a few *owed* a lot. (When I was younger, I\u2019d ask him if we were rich: \u201cYour mother and I are comfortably well to do. You don\u2019t have a dime.\u201d)\n\nStanley and Danko systematically studied the characteristics of millionaires. Some not-so-surprising facts: the most common millionaire car was an F-150 truck, which offered the most pounds of vehicle per dollar. A plumber making $100,000 per year was far more likely to be a millionaire than an attorney with the same income, because the latter\u2019s peer group was far harder to keep up with. And so forth. If this book doesn\u2019t scare your spending habits straight, nothing will.\n\n**Hurdle Number Two: Finance isn\u2019t rocket science, but you\u2019d better understand it clearly.**\n\nDo you know the difference between a stock and a bond? Maybe you do, and maybe you don\u2019t, but a little review never hurts.\n\nSay you\u2019re starting a business. It\u2019ll be a bit before it starts making money, but from day one it\u2019ll have expenses, and you\u2019ll need money for that up front.\n\nYou can get that money in one of two ways: you can borrow it from relatives, friends, or from a bank, or you can sell an ownership interest to a friend or family member. For example, if your brother is half owner, he\u2019s entitled to half of all of your business\u2019s future earnings.\n\nNothing prevents you from doing both, and in fact that is what most large corporations do. If you do both borrow money *and* sell shares, then both legally and morally, you have to pay the lenders\u2019 interest and principal first. Only after they have been paid, and only after your other ongoing business expenses have been met, can you then pay out the remaining profits to you and your brother.\n\nYou and your brother are thus the \u201cresidual owners\u201d of the business; if, and only if, you can pay off your lenders and your expenses do you make any money. *From the investors\u2019 perspective, an ownership stake (a stock) is much riskier than a loan to your business (a bond), and so the stock deserves a higher expected return than a bond.*\n\nThe term \u201cexpected return\u201d causes a lot of grief among neophyte investors. It\u2019s only what\u2019s *expected*, i.e., the average result; the *risk* is the chance that it will fall short. A coin toss that offers a dollar for heads and nothing for tails, for example, has an expected return of fifty cents, but there\u2019s also the 50/50 *risk* you\u2019ll get nothing.\n\nHere\u2019s a good way to think about the relationship between expected return and risk. You\u2019d probably\n\nprefer a certain fifty cents for each and every coin flip rather than a 50/50 chance of a dollar or nothing. In fact, most people would prefer even a certain forty cents; only at twenty or thirty cents of certain payoff would the average person prefer the coin flip; this is the point where the higher expected return of the coin flip adequately compensates for the 50 percent chance of getting nothing. (Economists use examples like this to gauge \u201crisk aversion.\u201d The person who will not take a penny less than a certain fifty cents to avoid the coin toss has zero risk aversion; the person who will take a certain ten cents to avoid the coin toss is highly risk averse. This paradigm is a good way to think about your own risk aversion\u2014that is, how much risk you can tolerate.)\n\nPut another way, bond ownership has no other upside beyond the full repayment of interest and principal, so it needs to be safe; stocks, on the other hand, need to have their potentially unlimited upside to entice investors who must endure their high risk. Put yet another way, if stocks and bonds were equally risky, no one would own the bond, with its limited upside; conversely, if stocks and bonds had the same return, no one would want to own the stocks, with their higher risk.\n\nThis raises a more subtle point, and one that is often not well understood by even sophisticated investors, which is that the interests of the owners of stocks, who are willing to take considerable risks to get higher returns, and the owners of bonds (or, in the case of a small business, the folks loaning it money), who care only about safety, are very different, and it\u2019s a company\u2019s stock owners who get to vote, not the bond owners. For this reason, loans to businesses\u2014corporate bonds\u2014are in general a bad deal, and it is a good idea to confine your bond holdings to government offerings.\n\nHow risky are stocks? You\u2019ve *no* idea. During the Great Depression, stocks lost, on average, around 90 percent of their value; during the recent financial crisis, they lost almost 60 percent. Although you might think that you can tolerate this kind of loss, guess again. It\u2019s one thing to think about temporarily losing 60 percent or even 90 percent of your savings, but the actual experience, in the moment, is unimaginably upsetting. In the words of Fred Schwed, one of the most astute observers of the investment scene (and certainly the funniest):\n\nThere are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words or pictures. Nor can any description I might offer here even approximate what it feels like to lose a real chunk of money that you used to own.\n\nIs it possible to predict when such declines might occur, and so avoid them? Don\u2019t even think about it: in the past 80 years, no one, and I mean no one, has ever done so reliably. Like a broken clock that is right twice a day, many have predicted a single bear market fall, but their future forecasting ability always evaporates, exactly what you\u2019d expect from a lucky guess, and not from skill.\n\nIs it possible to find a mutual fund manager or advisor who can beat the market? Again, no: several decades of careful research have shown that managers with superb prior performance usually fall flat on their faces going forward. (Over the past decade, even Warren Buffett has failed to beat the market by any significant margin.)\n\nThe simplest way to think about investing \u201cskill\u201d is to imagine a stadium containing 10,000 people. Everyone stands up and flips a coin: heads you stay up, tails you sit down. The laws of probability tell us that after 10 coin flips, on average about 10 flippers will still be standing. Were they skillful? Of course not. The poster child for this phenomenon is a money manager named William Miller, whose Legg Mason Value Trust mutual fund beat the S&amp;P 500 index of stocks for *fifteen* straight years before giving back nearly all of his cumulative advantage over that index in just three short years.\n\nThink about it another way. Say you could time the market or successfully pick stocks. Would you be publishing a newsletter, telling people about your predictions on TV, running a mutual fund, or, ha ha, working as a stock broker? Of course not. You\u2019d borrow as much money as you could, bet on your predictions with that borrowed money, and go to the beach. (You might also run a hedge fund, and so direct much of the upside to yourself and all of the downside to your clients.) When all is said and done, there are only two kinds of investors: those who don\u2019t know where the market is headed, and those who don\u2019t know that they don\u2019t know. Then again, there is a third kind: those who know they don\u2019t know, but whose livelihoods depend on *appearing* to know.\n\nIf you don\u2019t find that convincing, think about investing in yet another way: When you buy and sell stocks, the person on the other side of the trade\u2014the person or organization you\u2019re buying from or selling to\u2014almost certainly has a name like Goldman Sachs or Fidelity. And that\u2019s the *best* case scenario. What\u2019s the worst case? Trading with a company insider who knows more about his employer than 99.9999% of the people on the planet. Trading stocks and bonds is like volleying with an invisible tennis opponent. More often than not, that person turns out to be one of the Williams sisters.\n\nIf I had to summarize finance in one sentence, it would go something like this: if you want high returns, you\u2019re going to occasionally have to endure ferocious losses with equanimity, and if you want safety, you\u2019re going to have to endure low returns. At the end of the investing day, only two kinds of assets exist: risky ones (high returns and high risks, namely stocks), and what are known in finance as \u201criskless\u201d ones (low risks and low returns, like T-bills, CDs, and money market funds). Job one for the investor is to figure out the appropriate mix of the two. For example, the three-fund portfolio presented at the beginning of this book consists of two thirds risky assets and one third riskless assets.\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to estimate the returns of the stock or bond markets tomorrow, or even next year, it\u2019s actually not too difficult to estimate them in the very long term. First, government bonds. The 30- year U.S. Treasury bond, as of this writing, yields around 3.6%. This is a pretty good estimate of its return over the next 30 years. But this is a nominal return, and recall I just told you that you want to think in real, inflation-adjusted terms. Well, the Treasury also offers a 30-year inflation-protected security (TIPS), that currently has a real 1.4% yield and return of real principal, both of which rise over time with inflation. So the expected real return of the 30-year bond is . . .1.4%.\n\nStocks are only slightly more complicated. Domestic stocks currently yield a dividend of around 2%, foreign stocks around 3%. This is a *real* yield, since historically the *real* dividend payout increases at around 1.5% per year. Since the stock price should increase roughly in line with this growth in dividends, the real return of stocks should be the sum of the current yield and the growth rate\u2014that is, for domestic stocks, the 2% yield plus the 1.5% growth rate, or 3.5%, and for foreign stocks, about 4.5% (their current 3% dividend plus the 1.5% dividend growth).\n\nThus, a portfolio that is two thirds stocks and one third bonds *should* have a long-term expected real return of around 3%, and this is also where the suggested 15% savings rate for someone who starts saving at age 25 comes from. Most young people are familiar with Microsoft Excel, so I\u2019ve uploaded a spreadsheet that shows the effects of varying returns rates and saving rates in terms of real, accumulated assets after 20, 30, and 40 years to www.efficientfrontier.com/files/savings-path.xls. The name of the game is to accumulate around 12 years of living expenses (cells H12 to H16), which, combined with Social Security, should provide for a reasonable retirement. How did I arrive at 12 years of living expenses? The average person needs to accumulate about *twenty-five* years of living expenses, and I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ll be getting about half of that from Social Security.\n\nSo much for an introduction to basic finance. Your next reading assignment is Jack Bogle\u2019s *Common Sense on Mutual Funds*, perhaps the best introduction to basic finance that\u2019s ever been written.\n\nI\u2019ll end this section with one more bit of full disclosure. I\u2019m proud to call Jack Bogle an acquaintance, but he\u2019s also the founder of the Vanguard Group, which is now the world\u2019s largest mutual fund company. Four decades ago, he made a fateful decision, which was to give ownership in the company to the *shareholders of the mutual funds.* That is to say, when you own a Vanguard mutual fund, *you* are the owner of the company that offers it. Because Vanguard\u2019s shareholders own it, the company has no incentive to gouge them with excessive fees and hidden expenses.\n\nThis is the only mutual fund company for which this is true; when you own the shares of any other fund company, you are *not* the owner, and it is in the interest of the company\u2019s real owners\u2014the stock shareholders or private owners of the fund company\u2014to keep fees high.\n\nConsequently, Vanguard\u2019s fund expenses are generally the lowest in the industry, and the company is my go-to for most investors, whether they have a few thousand dollars or hundreds of millions. I have occasionally been accused of being a \u201cshill\u201d for Vanguard; if wanting to be the owner of my fund company and so pay rock-bottom fees makes me a shill, then I plead guilty.\n\nJack Bogle, while not a poor man, would almost certainly be a billionaire many times over had he retained ownership in the company, instead of giving it away to the fund shareholders. He is the only person in the history of the financial services industry to have done so and, as you might expect, he has remained, long after his retirement, a strong and clear voice for the rights of small investors everywhere.\n\nLong may he live.\n\n**Hurdle Number Three (with apologies to George Santayana): Those who ignore financial history are condemned to repeat it.**\n\nThere is no greater cause of mischief to the small investor than the confusion between the health of the economy and stock returns. It\u2019s natural for people to assume that when the economy is in good shape, future stock returns will be high, and vice versa.\n\nThe exact opposite is in fact true: market history shows that when there\u2019s economic blue sky, future returns are low, and when the economy is on the skids, future returns are high; it is a truism in the market that the best fishing is done in the most stormy waters. In the late 1990s, for example, people thought that the Internet would change everything. It did, but it didn\u2019t help the economy that much, and over the next decade stocks suffered not one, but two bone-crushing bear markets that resulted in more than a decade of negative real returns. By contrast, investors who bought stocks in the depths of the Great Depression (and in the depths of the more recent financial crisis) made out like bandits.\n\nBy now you know enough investment theory to understand this paradox: since risk and return are inextricably intertwined, high risk and high returns go hand in hand, and so do low risk and low returns. When the economy looks awful, risks seem high, and so stocks must offer high returns to entice people to buy them; contrariwise, when the economy looks great and stocks seem safe, they become more attractive to people, and this yields low future returns. Another way to put it is that the\n\nbiggest profits are made by buying at the lowest prices, and stocks only get cheap when bad economic news abounds; therefore, the highest returns are earned by buying when the economy is in the toilet, and vice versa.\n\nLearning market history isn\u2019t just about knowing the past pattern of returns (though that\u2019s helpful). In addition, it\u2019s about learning to recognize the market\u2019s emotional environment, which also correlates with future returns.\n\nThe 1929 market peak offered a classic example of the value of being attuned to sentiment; when asked how he knew to sell stocks the year before, Joseph Kennedy Sr. was said to have answered that when the shoeshine boys started offering him stock tips, he knew it was time to get out. In the 1990s, I had two \u201cshoeshine boy moments.\u201d The first came when I saw a TV advertisement for an online brokerage featuring a day trader who had just acquired his own island; the second came when a relative who did not know the first thing about investing joined her first stock club. (One version of the island commercial is available here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lnwkXb3B-k.) Similarly, you may have observed how during the early 2000s it seemed as though half your friends were flipping houses and brokering real estate and mortgages.\n\nWhy the correlation between popular interest and subsequent low returns? Simple: Driving the price of any asset higher requires the entry of new buyers, and when *everyone* is invested in stocks, real estate, or gold, there\u2019s no one left to join the party; the entry of nai\u0308ve, inexperienced investors usually signals the end.\n\nMarket bottoms behave the same way; when everyone is afraid of stocks, then there\u2019s no one left to sell, so prices are much more likely to move up than down.\n\nPut another way, we often depend on the recommendations of others for, say, restaurants, movies, doctors, or accountants; when all your friends report favorably on one, there\u2019s a pretty good chance that the recommendation is valid. Finance, though, for the reasons explained above, is the exact opposite; when all your friends are enthusiastic about stocks (or real estate, or any other investment), perhaps you shouldn\u2019t be, and when they respond negatively to your investment strategy, that\u2019s likely a good sign.\n\nA working knowledge of market history reinforces this sort of profitable but highly counterintuitive behavior\u2014i.e., to have seen the movie before.\n\nDoes the ability to recognize excessive market optimism or pessimism mean that you can \u201ctime\u201d the market? No, it does not. Rather, you should use your knowledge of financial history simply as an emotional stabilizer that will keep your portfolio on an even keel and prevent you from going all-in to the market when everyone is euphoric and selling your shares when the world seems to be going to hell in a hand-basket.\n\nThen again, the discipline of maintaining a fixed allocation, such as the 33/33/33 portfolio mentioned at the beginning of the book, is an easy and effective form of market timing, since it of necessity means that you will be buying more stocks after significant market falls, when pessimism reigns, and selling some stocks after prolonged and dramatic price rises, when the market seems to be making everyone rich. The real purpose of learning financial history is to give you the courage to do the selling at high prices and the buying at low ones mandated by the discipline of sticking to a fixed stock/bond allocation.\n\nSection Three\u2019s homework is a pair of treats, *Devil Take the Hindmost* by Edward Chancellor, a compendium of stock market manias; and its bookend, *The Great Depression: A Diary*, by Benjamin Roth, a portrait of how things look at the bottom. The lives of most investors encompass the two different kinds of markets described in these books, and they will provide a beacon that will guide you through both the best of times and the worst of times.\n\n**Hurdle Number Four (with apologies to Walt Kelly, creator of the** ***Pogo*** **cartoon): We have met the enemy and he is us.**\n\nAs you may already have guessed, the person most liable to screw up your retirement portfolio is you. A superb example of just how this happens is found in the March 29, 2013 edition of *Wall Street Journal*, in which reporter Jonathan Cheng described an agreeable, attractive married physician couple, Lucie White and Mark Villa. Wrote Mr. Cheng,\n\nFeeling \u201csucker punched,\u201d \\[by the global financial crisis\\] they swore off stocks and put their remaining money in a bank. This week, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index pushed to record highs, Ms. White and her husband hired a financial adviser and took the plunge back into the market. \u201cWhat really tipped our hand was to see our cash not doing anything while the S&amp;P was going up,\u201d says Ms. White, a 39-year-old dermatologist in Houston. \u201cWe just didn't want to be left on the sidelines.\u201d\n\nThis story speaks volumes about just how human nature can derail even the best designed portfolio.\n\nIn order to understand just how this happens, we need to consider the basics of human evolution. In a state of nature, the biggest risks to human existence tend to be attacks by predators and by other humans, and an ability to react instinctively and quickly carries real survival value. As human beings advanced from agricultural to industrial to postindustrial societies and as health and longevity improved, survival and the quality of life began to depend on a shift to long-run decision making\u2014up to a time horizon of several decades.\n\nLong-term planning, of course, is what investing is all about, and it\u2019s a predisposition that our maker most definitely did *not* endow us with. The nearly instantaneous emotional responses that served us so well on the prehistoric African plains turn out to be fatal in finance, as manifested in the buy-high sell- low behavior epitomized by the Villa-Whites.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just for starters. Human nature turns out to be a virtual Petrie dish of financially pathologic behavior. People tend to be comically overconfident: for example, about eighty percent of us believe that we are above average drivers, a logical impossibility. (Men tend to be much worse on this count, and thus worse investors than women.) We tend to extrapolate the recent past indefinitely into the future; in the 1970s, investors thought that inflation would never end, whereas now most people think it will never occur again. The first viewpoint was proven wrong within a few years, and the latter viewpoint most likely will be soon. Both long bear and bull markets also seem to take on a life of their own.\n\nMost importantly of all, humans are \u201cpattern seeking primates\u201d who perceive relationships where in fact none exist. Ninety-five percent of what happens in finance is random noise, yet investors constantly convince themselves that they see patterns in market activity.\n\nStatistics professors use this classic demonstration in introductory courses: the instructor leaves the room and asks all but one of the students to record the results of 30 coin tosses. The one remaining student, chosen by the class without the knowledge of the professor, is asked to *simulate* the tosses with pen and paper.\n\nThe professor returns and is able to quickly identify the single student who simulated the coin tosses. How? His or her simulations almost never contain 4 or more straight heads or tails, which almost always occur within 30 *random* coin tosses. The point here is that runs of 4 or more heads or tails are *perceived* as a nonrandom pattern, when in fact they are in fact the rule in random sequences, not the exception. Stock market participants frequently make this mistake, and an entirely bogus field of finance known as \u201ctechnical analysis\u201d is devoted to finding patterns in random financial data.\n\nOnce again, your homework in this section is a real piece of chocolate cake, *Your Money and Your Brain*, by the *Wall Street Journal*\u2019s Jason Zweig; I can guarantee you that you\u2019ll enjoy it immensely, and if Jason can\u2019t save you from yourself, then no one can.",

        "selftext": "I recently learned about Series I US Savings Bonds and their interesting pro/con list. Ultimately they are awesome for my circumstances and I'll be buying the limits this year. \n\nOn another note, by contributing $3500ish to a Fidelity HSA, I directly reduced my annual tax burden by $1200 and gained another tax advantaged account. HUGE win, as my my income is too high to deduct traditional IRA contributions. \n\nBoth of these vehicles have imposed limits, which makes sense from the government's perspective. They are also things I only discovered after going down the personal finance rabbit hole; kind of hidden in plain sight (especially the Series I Bonds), at least to a simple investor like myself.\n\n**My question for the group is:** what other 'hidden in plain sight' methods are you passionate/excited about outside of the standard IRA/401k/HSA? I've maxed all of those and am putting extra dollars into taxable brokerage, but I'd be interested in other tactics for reducing tax liability and/or taking advantage of limited systems.\n\nTo clarify, I'm not referring to speculative investments like crypto/REITs, but rather vehicles for optimizing the standard Boglehead portfolio in creative, lesser-known ways.",

        "selftext": "**Just logged into Reddit for the first time in a while and saw one of my comments had gotten some attention.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5wdgj6y0yev61.png?width=725&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7518d92b90892727112c136cca4ddc20ca7319a2\n\nFrom some of the questions I got, I thought it would helpful to share a handful of steps on how newer investors can set up an easy &amp; super smart portfolio.\n\nMany of us love to get into the weeds and spend endless hours thinking about tweaks that may or may not (equally likely) improve our returns by 1%, but\u00a0**the goal of my recommendations here is to set up the optimal portfolio for someone who wants to invest wisely, but also doesn't want to spend more time than needed tinkering with it.**\n\nBelow I'll walk you through a few easy steps to set up a globally diversified, low cost portfolio with one single fund. It'll just take an hour or two and once you set it up and won't require any tinkering in the future.\u00a0**Best of all, it'll put you in a position to outperform something in the ballpark of 80%+ of all other investors after accounting for fees.**\n\nThis isn't just my opinion. If ya look at the research, you'll find:\n\n1. Low fee index funds beat actively managed mutual funds a majority of the time on an after-fee basis\n2. A vast majority of active traders underperform\n3. No one has a clue which markets will outperform in the future and therefore diversification is a great way to go.\n\nHistorically, the market's returned 10%. Here's some motivation. **If you compound $100k at 10% over 30 years, you'll have $1.7M**. The magic of compounding.\n\nA note on bonds:\n\n**I'm just talking about stocks &amp; money markets here but for many if not most investors bonds can still play a role.** They play an essential role for folks with shorter time horizons. \n\nTraditionally, the rule has been to subtract your age from the number 110, and that's the percentage of your investments you should have in stocks. So if you're 30, this rule would mean you have 80% in stocks and 20% in bonds. In today's interest rate environment, the rule should probably use the number 120 or 130. In addition to age, the other consideration is how soon you'll likely need the $ you're investing. If you don't have stable income, or you have health conditions that could result in unplanned medical bills, or you're planning to use the $ you're investing relatively soon, you should have a more conservative allocation.\n\nAs for which bonds, I'd suggest either BSV, a short term bond fund, or splitting your bonds 50/50 between BSV &amp; BND. The combo means you have a total bond portfolio tilted towards short term bonds. Short duration bonds have the least interest rate/inflation risk which is what you need to look out for. If/when rates increase, which they're very likely to in the years ahead, bonds will depreciate. If we get bad inflation, that's kryptonite for bonds, especially long bonds.\n\nA few examples. My parents are 70 and 2 years away from retirement. I have them in 45% bonds, 55% stocks. A decade ago I would've put them in 55% bonds. Their portfolio tilts towards short duration. My sister set up a college savings account for my 12 year old nephew. He's in something like 30% bonds now, and will shift a bit towards bonds as he approaches college age. I'm 32, healthy, and reliably employed. I don't have any bonds.\n\nThis wouldn't have been true a decade ago, but today, if you're under 40 and you're investing for the long term, I think you can get away without bonds. The prevailing industry view is probably that a 40 year old should have 30% in bonds. I think that's insane.\n\n**How to set up a hands-off portfolio in 5 steps:**\n\n1. **Decide how much to hold in cash.**\u00a0Calculate how much $ you spend on monthly expenses. If you're healthy &amp; have stable income, set aside $ to cover at least 3-6 months of expenses in a checking account. Now think about anything you know you'll wanna spend $ on in the next year (tuition, new car, etc). That's the bare minimum you should be in cash. No harm in adding an extra cushion, just keep in mind that \"investing in cash\" is a decision too. Choosing to be in cash locks you in to 2-3% depreciation per year (could become even worse with inflation). The value of cash halves every 16 or 17 years. (!) Stocks are volatile and can draw down as much as 30% in a bad year, but over the long term they've returned 10% per year, and most expect average returns of 7-8% per year going forward. Once you decide on an amount you always wanna have in cash, write the number down. You'll wanna remember it. Since I'm healthy/employed/youngish I'm pretty aggressive. I tend to have 3-4K in my checking account at all times, plus 3-4k in a money market fund sitting in my individual broker account (\\~7k). My colleague is a bit older and has higher expenses so he likes to have 5K in his checking &amp; 25k in his emergency fund (\\~30k). 7k-30k is probably a reasonable spectrum.\n2. **Open up an individual broker account in Fidelity or Schwab**. They're both equally good and better than the alternatives. Both have free trades, fractional shares, access to a broad selection of funds without fees, 24/7 customer service, &amp; they don't do shady stuff like Robinhood does (sell order flow to 3rd parties, execute trades at worse prices, make it tricky to sell particular shares for tax purposes).\n3. **Put your money in one fund - VT.**\u00a0VT is the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF. This one fund gives you access to a globally diversified portfolio for a 0.08% expense ratio. Pretty remarkable. If possible,\u00a0**try not to withdraw $ you've invested within the first year. Capital gains taxes are higher for short term (&lt;1 year) gains.**\n4. **If you haven't already, open up a Roth IRA and (if you can) put $6k into VT.**\u00a0You'll wanna have your IRA with the same broker you use for your individual account so it's convenient. If you already have an IRA, you may wanna roll it over so it's conveniently accessible in Fidelity/Schwab. The law lets us contribute up to $6k/year max into an IRA, which lets your $ grow tax-free, so you'll wanna take advantage of that as much as possible. You wont be able to touch this money until you're 59 and a half years old without a penalty. (Technically, you can actually withdraw the principal, just not the gains.) Of course, at some point if your retirement account becomes massive you may no longer need to add more $ to it but that's obvious.\n5. **Whenever you earn money, throw it into VT.**\u00a0Don't worry about trying to time the market. Everyone thinks they can wait until markets dip and then add their $ but they're rarely lucky enough to do so. Tons of research shows you're best off not worrying about the ups and downs of the day and just contributing as you're able.\n\nTo an extent, what's right for you depends on your situation.

        "selftext": "Interesting excerpt from the rational reminder podcast with Paul Merriman about a meeting with Jack Bogle about S&amp;P500, Total Market, International and Small Cap Value.\n\n[https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/147](https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/147)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Jack Bogle. That was one of the questions that our community board had asked us to ask you about was that meeting you had with him I believe in 2017. Can you talk about that meeting? Did it change any of your views on investing?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Well, it changed a lot about investing for me. I loved the fact that he was going to give me an hour in his office. He gave me an hour and a half. I'd heard he is a little bit on the gruff side, if he wants to be. He was as gentle and as nice as he could be with the exception of about 30 seconds. What I found was I always thought of Vanguard and John Bogle as being my competition, because they were preaching a different story and advocating a different combination of asset classes. I had a hard time understanding what part of the academic research did John Bogle not understand? He was very open to talk about it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It turned out Vanguard was not our competition. We were in a totally different part of the world in terms of the investors that we were serving. But from their world, they wanted everything to be as simple as possible, they wanted it to be as acceptable as possible. For example, if we have a portfolio that is partly small and partly large in value, in growth, etc, and the S&amp;P 500 is doing great and these other asset classes aren't, we have prepared our clients that that is the way it goes. This is the other side of the coin when you have broad diversification.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He says, \"Our clients can't take that. We need clients who are satisfied with being,\" for example, he was always an S&amp;P 500 guy. When we first started having him on the radio, he didn't want any international in the portfolio. He just wanted the S&amp;P 500. Later, gently he starts to add a little international, but he almost always he would say, \"But no more than 20%, because you just don't need it.\" He also started advocating for the total market index, which has virtually the same return as the S&amp;P 500 for the last 90-some years.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So it wasn't a big change. It was still a cap weighted, but it means it's cap weighted in companies that the people who are investing at Vanguard know and love probably. So when they're down, like from 2000 through 2009 when the S&amp;P 500 not only twice loses half of the value of its portfolio, but the compound rate of return is less than 1% to negative 1% a year for that 10-year period. If that had been small cap value at a negative 1% and the S&amp;P 500 compounding at 7 or 8% like our accounts did, and if you were around back then, your accounts would have likely have done. We would have been gone. We would have been the devil incarnate, because we had those things and went down. But when it was the S&amp;P 500 that went down, people said, \"It's okay. They're great companies. They're here to last. It is simpler and more dependable.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That's what Vanguard wanted for people. He knew DFA. He knew all about DFA. He was a great fan of Fama and French. He approved of what the wrote, but he said, \"That doesn't mean it's right for our investors,\" which, by the way, goes over into the target date funds. It's the same thing. They want to treat people not like they're idiots, but they want to be gentle and make sure that they don't do something to disrupt the emotional attachment that they have to that target date fund.\n\nDFA -&gt; Dimensional Fund Advisors.",

I worked a low paying job and literally lived paycheck to paycheck. Made enough to cover rent, some food, and drugs.\nNext thing you know, I'm in my 30's and have nothing. I needed to change my life and thought the only way was through education.\n\nI stupidly signed up for a private school that cost a lot. I was so desperate to change my life that I was willing to go to school for $80,000. I passed the entrance exam, so I thought I could do it. I talked to my dad, and he co signed the student loans and let me move back home if I stayed away from drugs. Great, now I can turn my life around.\n\nSo I got to the 3rd year and ended up failing 2 classes which got me kicked out of the program. I went to every free tutoring class offered and still failed. I owed $80,000 with no degree and I felt like such a loser. I got really depressed and felt like a burden to my mom and dad. I started to believe that if I wasn't around anymore, things would be better for my family.\n\nMy sister actually saw me, and stopped me. When I saw the look in her face I felt so ashamed and bad for how much I hurt her, then I thought about what it would do to my parents. If my sister didn't come home at that exact time that day, I wouldn't be here today.\n\nWith great support from my family, I went back to community college and graduated with a degree. I passed the state exam and got my license to work in a healthcare setting.\n\nI started as per diem (basically on call worker), then part time, and for the past 2 years full time. I make $70,000 before taxes. Since I am living at home, I paid of my loans aggressively. I paid $74,000 in 3 years and still owe $6000.\n\nNow I have $46,000 in my savings and $10,000 in my checking account. My work does not match 401k, so I thought the best thing to do is to start a target retirement fund at vanguard. I maxed out the $6,000 for the past 2 years, but is that the right decision? Is a target fund the same as an IRA account? What is the best way to make sure I have enough when I'm retired? I'm thinking real long term, not get rich in 10 years. What is the best use of my money? Should I invest in anything else?\n\nAlso, the thing that sucks is I'm 43 and still live at home. I felt good about graduating and paying off a lot of student loans, but lately I've been feeling like a loser again because of my living situation. I would like to own a house, but that's not possible in my state. Maybe I can get a townhome or condo for $400,000.\n\nWhat should I do? Is it even smart for someone my age to own a home?  Rent in my area cost almost as much as a mortgage.\n\n\n\nI just want to be prepared for what I have left of my life. I don't need to be rich, but it would help a lot to not have to financially struggle when I get older than I already am.\n\nTHANK YOU!!\n\nEdit:. Wow thank you all for taking the time to help. It really means a lot to me.  Thank you for the kind words and great advice. \nI just wish I could've done this when I was younger.  I feel like I wasted the prime years of my life on drugs.

So, I feel like there is chance to reach some people who may be in the sweet spot for capitalizing on the value of an HSA.  I really wish that at 25 (instead of 45) I had known about the investment value of an HSA.  If you're in good health and your employer offers you a High Deductible Health Plan with an HSA  you should probably look into taking advantage of that. \n\nIn my case, since my wife and I are covered by the HDHP we can contribute $7200/yr to our HSA.  We are required to keep $2000 in cash in that HSA.  Every other penny that we contribute gets invested (we auto invest in VTSAX right through our HSA, every 2 weeks.)    \n\n\nWhy an HSA?\n\n1. you contribute pre-tax dollars..not paying taxes on money you earn is good.\n2. Your money grows tax free.  The magic of compounding over years and years without being taxed is a the secret sauce to growing your net worth (well, that and savings rate).\n3. If you withdraw money for qualified medical expenses it is tax free.  That means you're spending money you never paid any taxes on.  \n4. If you have the money to cover minor medical expenses you don't actually have to reimburse yourself from your HSA.  You can just leave all that money in the HSA, invested, and watch it grow over the years.  Just save your receipts because you can reimburse yourself later (any time later, eg 2060) for a medical expense incurred in 2021!  That gives your contributions years and years to grow before you withdraw them to cover an expense.\n5. At 65 you can withdraw from an HSA for any reason without penalty.  However, if the withdrawal isn't for medical expenses you will have to pay tax on the withdrawal.  Seriously though, the odds are exceptionally good that at age 65 you'll have plenty of medical expenses.  So you pull from the HSA to cover them with income (and growth) you've never paid taxes on. \n6. When you eventually do get on Medicare you can use your HSA to cover Medicare premiums, copays, deductibles.  That's a significant retirement expense that you have covered!\n\nHDHP and HSA can't possibly be right for every situation but if you're young, healthy, and could potentially cover the high deductible in the event you need it, an HSA an excellent investment/retirement vehicle.  I'm just hoping my relative good health holds out long enough for me to build a big ol' pot of money in my HSA account!",

        "selftext": "I posted some of this yesterday in [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and r/valueinvesting. Someone suggested to post it here to get talked down off the ledge. :) What I learned from those conversations yesterday was that I need a better conception of my risk tolerance and a plan I have confidence in. I think that as I've aged, my circumstances changed, and my nest-egg grew, my risk tolerance changed too but I didn't realize it was happening. \n\ntldr, I'm having a crisis of confidence in buy-and-hold index investing strategy\n\n**Backstory:**\n\nI'm 38 and live in the USA. I'm employed, and I make the median national income. I want to accrue wealth over the long term. I've been invested at Vanguard for 2 decades, over which time I've had 13.1% returns. I don't know that I have an accurate understanding of my risk tolerance. I think generally I am very cautious. Before yesterday I was about 70% equities, 15 bonds, 15 cash. Before a January I was almost entirely in the S&amp;P. I have no debts. I'm on track to retire with enough money for my lifestyle.\n\nI have been a buy &amp; hold index fund investor for the 20 years of my adult life. It always sort of bothered me that I didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of the markets I was investing in. At some point in the last decade I learned about the Schiller p/e index and thought \"hmm, this doesn't seem good...\" I read *Random Walk,* and I think I understood most of it.\n\nMost recent update is that after my sell-off freak-out a few days ago, I'm sitting at 42% value stocks, 42% cash, and  16% bonds diversified across US/XUS. \n\n**The Bug Out:**\n\nRecently, I heard a Grantham interview and read some Hussman, and their gloomy prognostication really struck a chord with my natural inclination towards pessimism. They say current prices are unthethered from the underlying assets and and that this is true across all sectors of the market. My friends and the forums are full people throwing money at speculative investments (currency, SPAC, etc). My elders are telling me to blindly invest in an index fund and forget about it, because 'historic returns, don't miss the market's big days, it worked for them, etc.'\n\nMy armchair diagnosis is that there are a lot of people like me that are blindly investing in broad index funds that could care less about the underlying value of the assets as long as the price keeps going up. I suspect at some time in the future we'll look back and see that index funds were a craze like any other and laugh at the certainly we currently feel that these assets will return 6-8% on average until the end of time. Looking at you Vanguard (who recently told me that a 'normal asset allocation' was 90-95% stocks...hmm). I also think we'll look back and see that the last trick the boomers played on us was propping up their asset valuations with Fed policy and leaving us to hold the bag.\n\nWorst of all, it doesn't seem like anyone I speak these concerns to (friends, family, investment advisors) is really taking them seriously or even hearing them. Am I turning into a flat-earther? Is the king wearing any clothes?\n\n**What Now?**\n\nI've been told you shouldn't try to time the market, and I've read the explainers about how I'm likely to mistime by selling below the peak, buying before the trough, and missing out on gains while out of the market. Frankly, I'm at a point where I don't believe in the market at all. Is not believing in the market at all the same as timing it? Why would I want to buy overpriced assets? I believe in a reversion to the mean. In this market, that means that some day in the future, the assets will cost less than they do now.\n\nI've heard that market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I've also read that by definition there is never greater certainty in the market than the day before the bubble pops.\n\nI'm not sure I can just put all of my money in an index fund and sleep at night. I have the following questions. Have some of you had a bug-out like I'm having now? Do you still believe in index funds in this current market? Why would I want to spend money on a fund with a p/e of 90 or a value fund with a p/e of 25? Isn't that a growth p/e, even if it's better by comparison?\n\nLastly, for this forum in particular, I think Vanguard's risk calculator is garbage. I just plugged in my answers and it told me to go 80 stock, 20 bonds. If that's the suggestion in my current mood, then something isn't working right. I spoke with an advisor there that told me 80/20 was the 'conservative' allocation. I think they are drinking their own cool-aid. Who can I trust to help me find my asset allocation?\n\ntldr2; I am questioning the fundamentals of my buy-and-hold index fund approach to investing. What the hell do I do? \n\nSorry this is such a mess of thoughts. Thanks in advance for any advice :)",

The reason for this post was that throughout the years my father and I always did stuff together and came up with ideas, so I thought we could enter the world of investing together now. He is turning 60 and I'm just starting my first job out of university (which is why I want to start taking care of my financial situation in life). As far as I know our country has a couple of retirement plans some of which are obligatory, so in that regard he is well taken care of for retirement (I need to investigate a bit more which of these plans are similair to the US ones that are talked about on this sub). I would also like to humbly point out that we have a firm grip on our family finances and would say we are \"well off\". Also he has savings money on the side. I have also already decided with my future wife about investing 10% of our paychecks as a retirement plan. Most of the comments talk about the problem with him taking risks, which I agree is the biggest barrier when talking about investing with him. And as the top comment says, there is little point in trying to convince someone in something they themselves wouldn't do. So the route I'm going to take is: I'm gonna start saving up part of my paycheck as said, and I'm going to continue learning about this way of investing while also taking in knowledge from my parents about finances regarding starting a family, becoming more independent etc. Then maybe after a few years I can show him the fruits of my early investing. It wouldn't be much I know, but it would hopefully serve as a positive example. If he wants to join me then, I would be happy.",

        "selftext": "Hi all, I wanted to share a quick story with you about why being a Boglehead is the best strategy, unless you like relying on luck and irrationality (if you've found your way here, you probably don't).\n\nI'm a public school teacher, so my primary retirement vehicle is my pension; the numbers involved aren't eye-popping but prove a simple point.\n\nBack in January, I got caught up in the fever of WallStreetBets, and then moved about 5% of my Roth IRA ($1000) into AMC at about $16 a share. Things were going to the moon, it was so exciting--and then--RobinHood throttled folks buying. \"Oh no,\" I thought, \"this company doesn't actually have value, and if everyone else stops buying it'll collapse in no time.\" Sure enough, the price dipped and I got out somewhat unscathed around $14 a share, losing less than $100.  Then the stock hung at around about $8 for a long while.\n\nNow of course, you'll likely have noticed that AMC went berserk today, for absolutely no reason other than the irrationality of \"meme stocks\" surging all around and/or sticking it to shorts. If I had held, I'd have made myself a few thousand. But herein lies the problem:\n\n1. How could anyone have predicted it would randomly spike now?\n2. When it starts to spike, when do you sell? Knowing my relatively conservative nature I'd have sold at something like $20, and then just felt bad after it went way higher.\n3. The price surging relies on others buying into the hype. I don't know about you, but I never want to have to rely on the reddit hivemind for financial growth.\n\nHere's my main point and what's most relevant to this sub: Had I just bought $1000 worth of VTWAX, I'd have made $117 instead of losing $90. Trying to play the game, I lost myself $200 effectively. There's simply no way, especially in this scenario, to be smart--you have to just be lucky.\n\nBut there was actually a greater cost: my time and energy. I was checking Google Finance constantly to see what other people were doing with my meme stock. Why? Because it wasn't a good value buy. It was a game where everyone was trying to outsmart the other guy into holding the bag--and I want no part in that. If I had stuck to 100% VTWAX (I'm back there now, FWIW), I'd have saved myself time, energy, stress, and made $117.",

        "selftext": "Well, I want to Bogle. I've read the wiki and been following this sub for a while. But my problem is, I feel like I'm too far behind to understand. I know I have money that I want to put into 3 funds. I'm 37 and own a business, my money is just in my bank account. I don't have or even know what the following are: 401K, Roth IRA. I've never owned a stock and I don't have an account with anybody except Bank of America checking/credit card/savings. I'm sure I'm supposed to know some of this stuff given my age and that I own a business, but I just don't.\n\nI'm a little embarrassed to be asking this here but how do you get started? I don't mean which 3 funds to choose (I feel like I'm on the step before this step), but like do I just go make an account on [Vanguard.com](https://Vanguard.com)? I see Vanguard talked about the most. And then when I have the account do I just search for the things like VOO/VTI and buy them? I see stuff about fees and taxes. I just want to park my money somewhere and not worry about it. I follow a few different investing subs and it seems like more often than not the things from this sub get mentioned over there.\n\nThe wiki says that a 3 fun portfolio is VTI, VXUS, and BND. So my plan is to do that. I just feel like I'm missing the step that's before actually having that. I don't have debt or any major bills. Not married and no kids. I don't plan on touching the money for the foreseeable future, I just want to participate in my money making money. I think I'm rambling at this point but any help would be appreciated! Thank you.",

        "title": "Ray Dalio Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises Summary",
        "selftext": "# **Ray Dalio**\n\n# **Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises**\n\n- Policy makers have 4 levers to pull when dealing with debt\n  - Austerity\n  - Debt defaults/Restructurings\n  - Central Bank printing money &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot;\n  - Transfers of money and credit\n- The first 2 are deflationary and the latter 2 are inflationary. Which levers the policy makers pull determine who benefits and who suffers. This process is painful for everyone\n- **Template of a debt crisis**\n- Typically occur because debt and debt service costs rise faster than the incomes needed to service that debt\n  - Usually, a central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering interest rates, but severe crises occur when that is no longer possible. IE - 0% interest rates\n  - Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles leads to a long-term debt cycle.\n- Long term debt cycles are just bigger versions of short-term debt cycles\n- During the upswing, credit is freely available and people are willing to take on more risk\n- Credit is cut during a crisis. Asset prices fall, debtors have trouble servicing debt, investors get scared and cautious which leads to liquidity problems\n- Deflationary Depressions \u2013 typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by the local currency\n- Inflationary Depressions \u2013 typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by foreign currency\n- Positive effects of debt cycles come first; negative come later\n- Typically, the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth\n  - This is because policymakers make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth, not on debt growth itself, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will be able to be serviced\n- It is the tightening of monetary policy that usually pops a bubble\n- No specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst in 1929\n- During a severe economic downturn, protectionist/populist policies begin to rise and outrage over the governments role in &amp;quot;bailing out&amp;quot; financial institutions\n- Once policymakers shift their attention to increasing financial regulation and oversight, that typically signals the of the big debt cycle\n- It is typically the case that the first tightening or policy does not hurt stocks and the economy\n- By 1937, all currencies had all devalued a lot against Gold, but not so much against each other\n- Gold bullion is the only asset that has no counterparty risk\n\n# **Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle**\n\n- Early \u2013 Debt is not growing faster than incomes. Debt is financing activities that produce growth. Known as &amp;quot;Goldilocks&amp;quot; period\n- Bubble \u2013 Debt is rising faster than incomes and this produces strong asset returns and growth. This process is generally self-reinforcing because it allows people to borrow more. This can go on for decades. These are short term cycles but lots of them adding up can lead to a long-term debt cycle\n  - Usually start from Bull markets. Lower interest rates drive asset prices higher, which leads to economic growth and the ability to take on more debt\n  - Lending standards are reduced as people and business lever up\n  - Lenders and speculators make lots of fast/easy money which reinforces the bubble\n  - As a bubble nears the top of the cycle, the economy is the most vulnerable, but people are feeling the wealthiest and the most bullish\n  - The Boom encourages new speculators into the market further driving up prices\n  - Humans by nature tend to move in crowds and weight recent experiences more heavily. This causes people to extrapolate too much from the recent past in both up and down markets\n  - Central banks usually target inflation or inflation/growth and don&amp;#39;t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth they enable can go on to finance the creation of bubbles. And the bursting of bubbles can cause severe economic pain\n  - Don&amp;#39;t only look at one metric to serve as an indicator of a debt crisis\n  - Monetary policy, in many cases, helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it\n    - How to Spot a Bubble\n      - Prices are high relative to traditional measures\n      - Broad bullish sentiment\n      - Purchases are financed by high leverage\n      - New buyers enter the market\n      - Buyers make very forward purchases to speculate or protect themselves from future price gains\n      - Stimulative monetary policy reinflates the bubble and tight monetary policy contributes to its popping\n- The Top \u2013 prices have been driven by a lot of leveraged buying and the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes rip for reversal\n  - Most often occurs when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise for whatever reason\n  - This causes a debt service squeeze and hurts asset prices. Which reduces the amount of money lenders are willing to lend out as they become cautious\n  - Investors move from risk assets to less risky assets slowing down growth\n  - A negative &amp;quot;wealth effect&amp;quot; occurs when one&amp;#39;s wealth declines, which leads to less lending and spending. This is due to both negative psychology and financial condition\n  - Yield curve is usually flat or inverted\n    - People are incentivized to move into cash just before the crash which itself slows down lending\n  - Unemployment is low\n  - The more leverage that exists and the higher the prices, the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows\n    - Immediate post bubble period\n    - People mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; stocks failing to see that earning are likely to decline much more. They extrapolate too much from the recent past\n    - Wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, this hurt spending and lowers investments and makes borrowing more difficult\n    - As asset prices fall, the lenders tighten lending standards which hurts spending and investment\n    - This causes people to sell investments to raise cash which causes more driving down of prices and is a self-reinforcing cycle\n- The &amp;quot;Depression&amp;quot;\n  - In a normal recession, cutting interest rates can stimulate the economy. But in a depression, rates can&amp;#39;t be cut because they are already at 0%\n  - The central banks have to go to alternative ways to stimulate the economy. IE \u2013 &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money or stimulus\n  - Declines of 50% of people&amp;#39;s assets are common\n  - As the depression begins, defaults and restructurings hit the various people. Especially leveraged ones (Banks)\n  - Runs on banks are common\n  - At this stage of the cycle, debt defaults and austerity dominate which are deflationary\n  - People financial condition worsens, which makes lenders more reluctant to loan money. Which slows down the economy\n  - Usually, institutions and policymakers have learned from the past, but not every depression is the same as before and this catches them off guard. It doesn&amp;#39;t tend to play out like the last one that they are defending against\n  - If the central bank prints money to alleviate the credit shortage, it can cause inflation if not careful\n  - A big part of this deleveraging process is that people discover that much of what they thought they of as wealth was simply other people promises to give them money. And now those promises are not being kept and that wealth isn&amp;#39;t real\n  - Fear cascades through the system, and these fears feed on themselves and lead to a scramble for cash that results in a shortage (investors sell assets)\n  - The depression phase is dominated by deflationary forces of debt reduction\n  - The investor class experiences a tremendous loss of &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; wealth, and as a result, they become extremely defensive, they seek safety in liquid investments like bonds, gold or cash\n  - The 4 options policymakers have for dealing with the depression\n    - They are typically slow to react initially because they don&amp;#39;t want to bail out the people who got themselves into problems\n    - Austerity \u2013 Usually the most obvious thing to do. But it doesn&amp;#39;t bring the debt and income into balance. Government revenues fall and demands for government services rise which cause deficits to rise and subsequent rise in taxes. All this is bad\n    - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or Printing Money \u2013 The moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts to rectify the imbalances fail. However, those early efforts typically produce bear market rallies\n    - Debt defaults/Restructurings \u2013 You have to clean out the bad debt so the flow of money can continue to return to prosperity.\n    - Redistribute the Wealth \u2013 Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and they become glaring during the hard times. Political populism tends to take hold after this time period. Taxes on the rich become common talking points. Central bank purchases of assets disproportionally help the rich\n    - Stocks usually fall 50%\n    - Currency devaluation will usually be 50% against gold\n    - Deficits widen to 6% of GDP\n    - Economic activity falls about 10%\n    - Unemployment is 10-15%\n    - Aggressive stimulation usually occurs about 2-3 years into a depression\n- The &amp;quot;Beautiful Deleveraging&amp;quot;\n  - Happens when the policymakers move the 4 levers in a balanced way\n  - Printing money during this phase doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily cause inflation. It won&amp;#39;t if its offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces. If income is growing faster than debt, you will be ok. However, if debt is growing faster than income, you can have a problem.\n  - But central bankers can abuse the stimulative policy&amp;#39;s and cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; IE \u2013 Weimer Germany in the 1920&amp;#39;s\n  - Printing money and debt monetization/government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won&amp;#39;t work (IE \u2013 Already at 0%)\n  - All the deleveraging eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks)\n  - In the end, policy makers always print money because it is the easiest\n    - Austerity causes more pain than benefit\n    - Big restructuring wipes out too much wealth too fast\n    - Redistributing of sufficient size doesn&amp;#39;t happen without a revolution\n- Pushing on a string phase\n  - Late in the cycle, the policy makers have to be careful because their stimulative policies effects have diminished.\n  - Economy usually enters a low growth and low return of assets\n  - The danger of this phase is that too much money printing and subsequent devaluation can cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; to occur\n    - Monetary Policy 1\n      - Usually try to lower interest rates first. If that doesn&amp;#39;t work, they go to 2\n    - Monetary Policy 2\n      - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money and buying financial assets. But over time, QE&amp;#39;s ability to stimulate the market is reduced as asset prices are high and risk premiums are low. IE \u2013 investors don&amp;#39;t want to buy expensive assets that are projected to have low returns. Investors move into cash for protection which makes further QE less and less effective\n      - Sometimes at this phase, policy makers monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for QE reduced effectiveness. This may provide a short-term boost but there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency&amp;#39;s suitability as a store of value. This can cause investors to rush to safe havens like Gold\n      - At some point, low interest rates and low premiums on risk assets from monetary policy 2 don&amp;#39;t work anymore and policy makers look to Monetary Policy 3 to stimulate the economy\n    - Monetary Policy 3 \u2013 Where the US is at in 2020\n      - Puts money directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it\n      - Government provides direct or indirect stimulus payments in many different forms\n- Normalization\n  - System gets back to normal. But this usually takes 5-10 years and economic activity is slow during this time frame. And it takes investors a very long time to get comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again\n\n# **Inflationary Depression**\n\n- Reserve currency countries that don&amp;#39;t have significant foreign currency debt can have inflationary depressions, they usually emerge more slowly and later in the process, after sustained and repeated overuse of stimulus to reverse a deflationary deleveraging.\n- If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for the currency, erode its reserve currency status (IE make investors view it less as a store of wealth) and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one\n\n# **Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle**\n\n- Countries with the worst debt problems, a lot of debt denominated in a foreign currency, and a high dependence on foreign capital typically have severe currency weakness. This currency weakness is what causes inflations when there is a depression\n- Inflationary Depression can happen to any country but are most likely if\n  - Don&amp;#39;t have reserve currency\n  - Have low foreign exchange reserves\n  - Have large foreign debt\n  - Have large and increasing budget and/or deficit\n  - Have negative real interest rates\n  - History of high inflation\n- 5 Stages of debt cycle. Follow the deflationary cycle until the depression stage\n  - Early \u2013 Low debt levels. Productive Investments. Attraction of foreign capital due to investment returns. Usually enter into a foreign exchange market to sell their currency for the incoming foreign currency to prevent it from rising and keep their exports attractive.\n  - Bubble \u2013 Good asset returns, strong capital inflows, and strong economic conditions create a self-reinforcing cycle. But debts are rising faster than incomes. Asset prices are bid up and increasingly financed by debt. Country becomes the &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; place to invest and investors who were never involved want in which sets the country up for a reversal. Country becomes reliant on debt and foreign capital rather than productivity for gains. Stocks might average 20% per year for several years during this phase\n  - Top \u2013 Bubble bursts. The inflows of capital which caused the bubble are reversed. Asset prices fall, interest rates rise and banks fail. Could come from some type of shock like a reduction in oil prices. Worry increases on the part of both asset/currency holders and policymakers who are trying to support the currency. Investors worry about their ability to get their money out which causes them to get it out while they still can\n    - Central bankers first make bold statements about defending the currency\n    - Central banks then try to defend their currencies but these rarely work\n      - Spending down reserves\n      - Raising rates\n    - Last line of defense before they give up is to install capital controls which never works\n  - Depression \u2013 Policy makers stop fighting and let the currency decline. A gradual and persistent currency decline causes the market to expect continued future currency depreciation which isn&amp;#39;t good. Most countries do a one-off devaluation so it catches the market off guard. Policy makers usually say they will continue to defend the currency right up until they don&amp;#39;t. After policy makers let the currency go, people push to get their money out of the currency.\n    - Usually, 30% decline in the currency\n    - 50% fall in equities in local currency and even worse in foreign currency\n  - Normalization \u2013 Supply demand balance return. Typically takes investors a few years to return (2-3). But the price of domestic goods and labor fell with the currency making it an attractive investment for foreign investors, which helps growth\n\n# **Hyperinflation**\n\n- If countries continue to prop up growth rather than bring spending in line with income. And this is done repeatedly over the years, a hyperinflation episode can result\n- Inflation psychology sets in with the public. Currency declines inspire additional flight, which causes a feedback loop\n- People totally lose faith in the currency as a store of value\n- How to invest during a hyperinflation episode \u2013 Short the currency, get your money out of the country, buy commodities (Gold), and invest in commodity industries (Gold, Oil, etc)",

Investor return decrease as motion increases.\n- Winning Strategy for investing is to buy a fund that holds all market portfolio and hold it forever\n- The index fund eliminates the risks of individual stocks, market sectors, and manager selection. Only stock market risk remains, which is large\n- A traditional index fund operates with minimal expenses, no advisory fees, with tiny portfolio turnover, and high tax efficiency.\n- Investing in equities long term is a winner&amp;#39;s game\n- The returns earned by business are ultimately translated into the stock market\n- Investing is a zero-sum game, for every person that beats the market by 1% someone else lost by 1%.\n- Mutual fund investors are confident they can easily select the right fund managers. They are WRONG\n- When the stock temporarily overperforms or underperforms the business, a limited number of shareholders receive outsized benefits at the expense of those they trade with\u2026. Over time, the aggregate gains made must of necessity match the business gains of the company\n- The stock market returns must equal the business returns over a long period. But this goes up and down in cycles. As investors are willing to pay higher or lower P/E.\n- Investment yield on stocks (dividends plus dividend earnings growth) tracks with the total market return. About 9.5% for the last 100 years\n- Reversions to the mean \u2013 Tendency for P/E ratios to return to their long-term norms over time.\n- Economics controls the long-term stock market return.

Accurately predicting short term emotions is impossible\n- Occam&amp;#39;s razor \u2013 when there are multiple solutions to a problem, choose the most simple\n- Solution \u2013 buy and hold a diversified, low cost portfolio that tracks the stock market\n- Investors as a group must earn precisely the market return, BEFORE THE COSTS OF INVESTING ARE DEDUCTED \u2013 when we subtract all the fees, turnover, taxes, commissions, sales loads, advertising, and legal fees \u2013 the returns of investors will fall short of the market by precisely those costs. The lower these costs the better\n- Before costs, beating the market is a zero-sum game, after costs, it is a loser&amp;#39;s game\n- Focus on the lowest cost funds \u2013 the more managers take, the less investors make\n- Don&amp;#39;t invest in funds based on past performance. Performance comes and goes. But costs go on forever\n- Costs\n  - Expense Ratio\n  - Sales Charge\n  - Purchase and sale of securities or turnover\n  - Assume the turnover costs equal 1% the turnover rate. IE - 100% turnover = 1%. 50% turnover = 0.5%\n- Low cost funds beat high cost funds\n- Most equity fund investors actually get lower returns than the funds they invest in.\u2026. why? Counterproductive market timing and adverse fund selection. Most investors put money in as a fund is rising and pull money out as it is falling. Investors chase past performance.\n- Actively managed funds are tax inefficient due to turnover\n- Fund returns are devastated by costs, adverse fund section, bad timing, taxes and inflation\n- Don&amp;#39;t look for the needle, just buy the whole haystack\n- 355 equity funds from 1970 to 2006 \u2013 80% had gone out of business. Only 2 of the 355 funds had superior performance during this time (beat the index by 2%) 8 funds beat the index by 1%. The odds of you picking one of these funds is extremely low.\n- As the active fund does better, it has more inflows of cash which makes it difficult to maintain that advantage.\n- Picking a winner based on the past is hazardous duty\n- Over the long-term stocks have provided higher returns than bonds, so why own bonds?\n  - Bonds have beat stocks in 42 of the last 112 years\n  - They reduce volatility in the portfolio\n- Investors who seek to increase yields in their bonds by investing in junk bonds should be careful. If you are going to do it make it a very small percent of your portfolio.\n- Long term bonds are much more volatile than short term\n- Ben Graham \u2013 The average manager cannot obtain better results than the S+P 500. Investors should be content with earning the markets return. Only low-cost index investing can guarantee that outcome.\n- Asset allocation accounts for 94% of return. 2 factors that determine how you should allocate your portfolio\n  - Ability to take risk \u2013 depends on financial position, liabilities, years. In general, you are able to take more risks the longer time horizon you have\n  - Willingness to take risk \u2013 matter of preference. Some investors can handle the up and downs.

You can&amp;#39;t do it. No one knows where it will be next year.\n- A large study was done on financial newsletters, &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot;, and TV shows and it was determined there is no evidence that they can time the market and consistent with mutual fund studies, winners rarely win again and losers often lose again.\n- Picking mutual funds based on Morningstar&amp;#39;s rating system doesn&amp;#39;t work. 5-star portfolios have underperformed the S+P 500\n- Rebalancing works on the theory of RTM (reversion to the mean) so you are essentially selling high and buying low.\n- You can rebalance by selling your winners, putting new money into the underweight funds, or instead of reinvesting dividends, direct them toward the underweight funds. Think about the tax consequences of this if the funds are in a taxable account\n- It is not a good idea to not rebalance and let your winner&amp;#39;s ride. If you had done this in the late 90&amp;#39;s, tech would have been massively overweighed in your portfolio and you would have taken a huge hit. But if you rebalanced, you locked in some of those gains.\n- Tune out the &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot;\n- No one knows what the market will do short term\n- Mutual fund reporters lead a secret life.

Crude oil sank 7.5%, its biggest daily loss in almost a year.\n\nAirlines, oil and gas, cruise lines, hotels and shopping malls got pounded\u2014just as they had in February and March 2020. Grocery stores, online retailers, pharmaceuticals, technology and personal-hygiene stocks went up or held steady; they fared relatively well during last year\u2019s panic, too.\n\nPast performance suddenly felt like a guarantee of future results\u2014but investors should always remember that it isn\u2019t.\n\nHow similar was this Monday to last year\u2019s pandemic panic? Eight of the 20 worst decliners in the S&amp;P 500 this time had been among those with the deepest losses last time. [United Airlines Holdings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UAL) Inc., [UAL **-0.62%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UAL?mod=chiclets)down 5.5% this past Monday, had fallen 66.9% between Feb. 19 and March 23, 2020. [Oneok](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/OKE) Inc., [OKE **-0.96%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/OKE?mod=chiclets)the natural-gas company, fell 5.8% on Monday and 74.5% in the 2020 decline. [Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NCLH) Ltd. dropped 5.5% on Monday and 81.4% in last year\u2019s Covid crash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmong the biggest gainers: [Regeneron Pharmaceuticals](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/REGN) Inc., up 0.3% on Monday, after rising 13.7% in the 2020 crash; [Clorox](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLX) Co. , up 0.8% on July 19 and 3.2% in last year\u2019s rout; and [Kroger](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KR) Co. , up 4.3% on Monday and 5.2% in the 2020 slump.\n\nThen, starting on Tuesday, as [corporate earnings announcements elbowed Covid aside](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stock-markets-dow-update-07-21-2021-11626853787?mod=hp_lead_pos1&amp;mod=article_inline), the markets reversed. Many of Monday\u2019s winners went down, and lots of losers rose. Now, in effect, the market was expecting the post-March 2020 recovery to happen all over again.\n\nIt was a wacky few days, and investors might be forgiven if they momentarily forgot that the past never repeats itself exactly.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough habit to break: We live in a world in which skill and excellence often persist and price is generally a good signal of quality. Great athletes with a \u201c[hot hand](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hes-on-fire-what-nba-jams-hot-hand-reveals-about-the-power-of-streaks-11583256232?mod=article_inline)\u201d seem to score again and again; your favorite restaurant\u2019s food should be as tasty today as it was last month; a luxury car typically drives better than a cheap compact.\n\nAnd there\u2019s some truth to it in the markets, too. Stocks whose earnings and prices have recently been rising tend to [keep winning](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~lpederse/papers/ValMomEverywhere.pdf), while those that have lately been losers often keep losing.\n\nBut the stock market is a complex, dynamic system that doesn\u2019t follow the rules of restaurants or cars. Investing is so competitive that history can rarely repeat for long; if any past pattern reliably recurred, so many people would pounce on it that it would soon stop working. Indeed, when the winners-keep-winning patterns reverse, they can [deliver devastating losses](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.709.3262&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe human habit of pretending that a rearview mirror is a crystal ball is almost incorrigible. Investors like seemingly coherent explanations of market moves, such as those the news media provides. As soon as the market stops going up, those explanations\u2014no matter how arbitrary\u2014[tend to make the new \u201cdown\u201d world seem more likely to persist](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1988-01369-001).\n\nFinance professor Meir Statman of Santa Clara University [analyzed](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2469/faj.v56.n2.2340) more than a decade\u2019s worth of monthly surveys of individual investors. The proportion who expected stocks to go up over the coming six months rose, on average, by 1 percentage point with every percentage-point increase in the S&amp;P 500\u2019s returns for the prior month. It\u2019s as if investors [believe the medium-term future is shaped by the short-term past](https://fac.comtech.depaul.edu/wdebondt/Publications/A_portrait.pdf).\n\nTrying to get people to stop that behavior can backfire.\n\nIn [a new study](https://psyarxiv.com/c8pdw/) in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, behavioral scientists Peter Ayton and Leonardo Weiss-Cohen of the University of Leeds and Philip Newall of Central Queensland University tested disclaimers about past investment performance on 1,600 people in the U.S.\n\nRoughly 1,000 had at least some investing experience. In 60 rounds of the experiment, the participants chose between \u201cFund A\u201d and \u201cFund B.\u201d Each time, they saw each fund\u2019s fees and its gain or loss over the prior month. Those returns varied randomly\u2014but, on average, Fund A would outperform over time, because its fees were much lower.\n\n## \n\nStrikingly, when many investors viewed the standard mutual-fund disclaimer that \u201cpast performance does not guarantee future results,\u201d they chose the fund with higher fees *more* often.\n\n\u201cA lot of experienced investors seem to believe that the warning won\u2019t apply to them,\u201d says Mr. Weiss-Cohen. \u201cIt\u2019s maybe like they think, \u2018I can make it work, because I know better.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe phrase \u201cdoes not guarantee future results\u201d may cause investors to conclude\u2014erroneously\u2014that past performance is nonetheless a highly reliable indicator, says Mr. Newall. ([Low fees](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/bespeneckbo/default/AFA611-Eckbo%20web%20site/AFA611-S8C-FamaFrench-LuckvSkill-JF10.pdf) are a much better indicator of future outcomes than [past returns](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.319.2867&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) are.)\n\nWhat does discourage investors from chasing historical returns, the researchers showed, is a warning: \u201cSome people invest based on past performance, but funds with low fees have the highest future results.\u201d\n\nThat apparently prompts investors to make a social comparison between themselves and others. Who wants to settle for investing like \u201csome people\u201d? Everybody wants to \u201cget ahead of the Joneses,\u201d says Mr. Newall.\n\nSo, as you watch the market on its latest wild goose chase after past performance, remember: Some people invest like that. You don\u2019t have to.",

        "title": "So you're thinking about just investing in the 500 index ...",
        "selftext": "... here are some reasons you should diversify beyond that.\n\n1) The 500 index has a kind of legacy appeal because for decades it was the only available and/or cheap index fund - that doesn't make it better, it was just easier for fund managers to track a smaller index. Now that global funds are available with thousands of stocks at similarly low costs that legacy reasoning is moot. To put it more directly: if you want to diversify, why would you stop at 50 or 500 stocks when you could own so many more?\n\n2) A lot of people say it's 'diversified enough' but that sets of red flags of its own. The US has unique economic, political, cultural risks - take the Fed, which is holding down rates and arguably inflating stock valuations. Sure, it probably has some impact globally, but it has an outsize impact at home. Add to that the fact that small cap and international stocks (emerging in particular) add real diversification benefits to a US-only portfolio.\n\n3) A lot of people (consciously or not) are anchored on recent returns. Setting aside a huge wave of small cap value catching back up to large cap growth recently, winners rotate.\n\n4) And then there are the appeals to authority. It's *so easy* to fall into the trap of 'well it was good enough for Bogle and Buffett' (two guys whose generation benefited massively from unusually high US outperformance). But two old dudes (bless them both, they're good guys) are not the end-all, be-all for creating a portfolio. Also, they have/had so much money the US could crash and burn and they'd still have come out fine - they're not ordinary investors and I have a hard time believing the advice of billionaires applies to the rest of us.\n\n5) 'But the US is globally diversified already!' This one always stumps my brain, because on the one hand, sure, US companies do tons of international business, but (a) international businesses do tons of business with the US too, so that cuts both ways, and (b) that factoid doesn't account for huge, long-term divergences between actual US and international stocks (which have actually grown *larger* not smaller over recent years!).\n\nIt sure seems like a lot of people want to justify chasing recent hot winner, and unfortunately they have a lot of simplified material to draw on - old guys who are a bit out of touch but have the patina of investing geniuses, the fact that the US did do well this past decade (ignoring of course the decade before when it did horribly), and probably some subtle nationalism baked in too, at least for some people convinced of US exceptionalism. But here's the reality: markets reward risk. If the US is safer, it should have *lower* expected returns. So if you want safer, I can't fault you for sticking to the US, but if you want long-term diversified growth, consider branching out.\n\nI've probably missed some reasons along the way - I'm mainly responding to the most common arguments I've read recently. Note: I keep thinking I should unpin the post I made ages ago about recency bias and the US, but the fact that we regularly get *new* posts asking about US/large/growth tilts make me think it's still useful to have that up top.",

However, I figured since recently, I would just put 300 dollars a month or more, but minimum 300 dollars a month into VOO, and if possible, either VOO and another one of those ETFs. My portfolio already is like, 70% VOO. I plan on just keep adding at least 300 or more to VOO every month, since I just turned 21 a few months back and that's a decent amount for me to put in every month. Soon my portfolio probably will just be 80-90% VOO or higher  \n\n\nbut the thing that gets me, is.. On paper, all the research I've looked at, simply just investing and forgetting into VOO, should, over the course of me just living my life, generate wealth to the point where I can either live off the dividends from VOO, or sell shares of VOO to then put into a dividend ETF. But, thinking about it, it just seems too easy. I've always heard people talking about the stock market being some crazy lottery or some scam, but so far it's been fine for me, and I don't panic if I see any dips because I know the top 500 companies are going to be fine in the long term. Especially since with VOO/VTI, if those are down, it's not like I could have done anything different anyway. It's different if say, 70% of your portfolio dips while VTI/VOO is still high and green. But because I know that's my portfolio more or less, I'm not worried..   \n\n\nBut, am I missing something? It just feels, strange, that doing something so simple as just putting 300 into VOO over the course of me just living my life would generate a good investment. I don't need to do technical analysis, I don't need to monitor it 24/7, I don't need to do anything. I just DCA and that's it. It feels too simple but is it really that?",

Looking at the trend graph on mint made me appreciate how far I've come, from an empty bank account in August 2009 when I had just turned 21, having just graduated from college smack dab in the middle of the worst recession in recent memory, having no idea what a 401k was except that my dad told me \"put 15% in and pretend the money never existed\" (I had no idea what funds to allocate into so I just put an equal percent into every fund my provider offered, LOL) all the way until the beginning of this year, when I realized I needed to actually understand finances and investing after the GME and Dogecoin runups where I felt FOMO from never having consciously invested before. That feeling eventually brought me to bogleheads, where I am now the happy owner of a target date fund in my 401k, VTSAX and VTIAX in my brand new Roth IRA account, and AVUV and AVDV in a small taxable account.\n\nI know I'm young compared to some of the other investors here, and 12 years is just a blip as far as historical trends, but I'm putting this here to let others know that you can have absolutely no knowledge of finances, not even realize you have an investment account, never pick a single stock, never read a company earnings report, never know if the stock market is up or down, and over time be laying down the foundation for a future of financial independence.\n\nP.S. Ignore the blip in the middle of the graph, I moved jobs and never added that other job's 401k account to Mint, so it looks like my money disappeared for a few years lol.

        "title": "I did the HSA math. This is a no-brainer!",
        "selftext": "I've never really considered an Health Savings Account because I was scared by the High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) requirement. After doing the math, I've realize how wrong I was! In short, if you can save a couple hundred dollars per month, an HSA is possibly your best investment vehicle (after an employer-matched 401K). Here are the calculations to consider...\n\n#1 - Determine your tax savings. Find your tax bracket at https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets HSA contributions are pre-tax, so reduce your taxable income. I'm in the 22% bracket, so my tax saving is 22% on contributions. My state tax saving is an additional 5% (yours will vary based on state). Let's say I can contribute $300/month or $3600 year. My 27% tax savings would be $972/year.\n\n#2 - Determine your insurance premium savings. You'll need to consult your employer or health insurance provider. I work for a state education institution. My current family \"wellness\" plan is $174/month and the HDHP plan is $46/month - so a savings of $128/month or $1536/year.\n\n#3 - Consider how much MORE you might pay in health care expenses with the HDHP. This is the part that always scared me away, but it turns out it's nearly impossible to pay more than I would save.\n\nIf I have $0 in health care costs, switching to a HDHP and putting $300/month in an HSA would save me $2508/year ($972 tax savings + $1536 premiums savings).\n\nMy current plan has a $1500/family deductible (then 30%), whereas the HDHP has a $3000/family deductible (then 20%). If I had $3000 in expenses (doctor visits and one minor surgery or a couple ER visits per year, etc. - fairly typical for me), the savings would be around $1508/year ($2508 savings - ~$1000 difference in expenses).\n\nLet's say things go REALLY bad - like a serious accident, cancer, etc. My current plan max is $8000 and the HDHP max is $10000. In this worst-case scenario I still save $508 ($2508-$2000 max difference).\n\nThe only way I could lose money on an HSA is to contribute &lt;$140/month AND hit my $10K max out-of-pocket every year.\n\nSo, $140+/month in an HSA is already a no-lose scenario for me, but that doesn't consider the additional value of the tax-free HSA gains over time. This is best realized by never using HSA funds to pay medical expenses (unless you have to or until you want to). $300/month at a 7% annual return for 20 years returns $156,278 on $72,000 in contributions. Maxing out at $600/month returns $312,556 on $86,400 in contributions. THESE GAINS ARE 100% TAX FREE! You never pay taxes on HSA contributions, gains, or withdrawals (thus the triple-tax advantage)!\n\nNow, the HSA funds must be spent on health care expenses (or pay a 20% penalty). A couple can expect $300K+ in retirement health expenses. However, you can reimburse yourself for expenses incurred any time while on the plan - save your receipts for 20 years and then pay yourself. After age 65, you can apply them to long-term care expenses. Or you can use them on whatever you want by simply paying taxes on the withdrawals - making the HSA no different than a Traditional IRA.\n\nIs there anything I'm overlooking? Is the HSA really a no-brainer?",

        "selftext": "I was re-reading parts of *The Little Book of Common Sense Investing* (2017 updated version) and came across the below passage referencing investor underperformance through the crashes caused by the dot-com and subprime mortgage bubbles decades ago. The mentions of hot funds, growth funds, technology funds, etc. sound like they could just as easily be written about today's market. TL;DR regression to the mean will make today\u2019s winners tomorrow\u2019s losers - hold a passive total market index fund for the long haul and come out ahead.\n\n&gt;The evidence is compelling that (1) the long-term returns on equity funds lag the stock market by a substantial amount, largely accounted for by their costs; and (2) the returns earned by fund investors lag the market by more than double that substantial lag.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What explains this second shocking lag? Simply put, counterproductive market timing and adverse fund selection. First, shareholders investing in equity funds paid a heavy timing penalty. They invested too little of their savings in equity funds when stocks represented good values during the 1980s and early 1990s. Then, inflamed by the heady optimism and greed of the era and enticed by the wiles of mutual fund marketers as the bull market neared its peak, they poured too much of their savings into equity funds.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Second, they paid a selection penalty, pouring their money not only into the market at the wrong time, but into the wrong funds\u2014funds that had provided outstanding results in the past, but, as we shall soon see, tumbled thereafter. Why? Simply because high fund returns tend to revert toward or below the mean of average returns. (We\u2019ll discuss reversion to the mean\u2014RTM\u2014in Chapter 11.) With both counterproductive timing and poor fund selection, investors simply fail to practice what common sense would have told them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This lag effect has been amazingly pervasive. For example, the returns provided to investors from 2008 to 2016 by 186 of the 200 largest equity funds were lower than the returns that they reported to investors! This lag was especially evident during the \u201cnew economy\u201d craze of the late 1990s. Then, the fund industry organized more and more funds, usually funds that carried considerably higher risk than the stock market itself, and magnified the problem by heavily advertising the eye-catching past returns earned by the hottest funds. As the market soared, investors poured ever larger sums of money into equity funds. They invested a net total of only $18 billion in 1990 when stocks were cheap, but $420 billion in 1999 and 2000, when stocks were substantially overvalued.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What\u2019s more, investors also overwhelmingly chose \u201cnew economy\u201d funds, technology funds, and the hottest-performing growth funds, to the virtual exclusion of more conservative value-oriented funds. Whereas only 20 percent of their money had been invested in risky aggressive growth funds in 1990, investors poured fully 95 percent into such funds as those fund returns peaked during 1999 and early 2000. After the bubble burst, when it was too late, investor purchases dried up to as little as $36 billion in 2002, just before the market hit bottom. They also pulled their money out of growth funds and turned, too late, to value funds.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The underwhelming performance of fund investors returned during the financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 and the subsequent recovery. Fund investors have been chasing past performance since time immemorial, allowing their emotions\u2014perhaps even their greed\u2014to overwhelm their reason. Many investors reacted strongly\u2014and ultimately counterproductively\u2014to the sharp downturn in the markets during the financial crisis by getting out of stocks near the market\u2019s nadir. Many of those investors missed part or even all of the subsequent recovery, a cumulative increase by the end of 2016 of some 250 percent from the low.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The fund industry itself has compounded the problem by playing on investors\u2019 emotions, bringing out new funds to meet the fads and fashions of the day (often supercharged and speculative), and then aggressively advertising and marketing them. It is fair to say that when counterproductive investor emotions are played upon by counterproductive fund industry promotions, little good is apt to result. The fund industry will not soon give up on its new products or its promotions, and it will take time (and first-hand experience) by investors with counterproductive short-term behavior to gain wisdom. But the intelligent investor will be well advised to heed not only the message in Chapter 4 about minimizing expenses, but the message in this chapter about removing emotions from the equation\u2014that is, about investors improving their short-term, market-oriented behavior.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The beauty of the index fund, then, lies not only in its low expenses, but in its elimination of all those tempting fund choices that promise so much and deliver so little. Focusing on the long term, doing one\u2019s best to ignore the short-term noise of the stock market, and eschewing the hot funds of the day, the index fund can be held through thick and thin for an investment lifetime. Emotions need never enter the equation. ***The winning formula for success in investing is owning the entire stock market through an index fund, and then doing nothing. Just stay the course.***\n\nBogle, John C.. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing (Little Books. Big Profits) (p. 73). Wiley. Kindle Edition.",

I have seen people here say they put 20% of their portfolio in crypto.\n\nI know I may be under Dunning Kruger effect so tell me if  I am wrong.\n\nI will only consider Bitcoin. I know there are many other cryptocurrencies but they are less established.\n\nBy dollar, here I mean US dollar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Argument**\n\nI was reading about how a high dollar value will make American products more expensive overseas, which reduces the demand for American exports. It makes me think, if crypto became the mainstream currency in a country, that country's goods would become so expensive that the demand on their exports would tank. This would then tank their economy. I suspect countries may outlaw the use of cryptocurrency to prevent this. Some large countries such as Russia and China have already taken partial steps to outlaw cryptocurrency.\n\nIf crypto does not become the mainstream currency in any country, then crypto is more like a speculation than legitimate currency. However, unlike other speculation like antiques, art, real estate, etc. crypto has no inherent value.\n\nI think there is a futuristic bias with cryptocurrency: it is heavily invested in because people think it is the future. Unlike stocks which have benefited from futuristic bias, like Tesla, cryptocurrency is just currency- it doesn't have growth/earnings potential.\n\nUnlike currency such as gold, cryptocurrency can't be converted into jewelry, statues, etc. Gold seems similar to cryptocurrency in that it has a fairly limited supply, whereas the dollar is \"pretend\". As far as I know, no country currently uses the gold standard. Today economies run on \"pretend\" money which seems to work pretty well.\n\nI did some calculations to show that crypto is hundreds of times more variable compared to real currencies. Also, its value is steadily increasing compared to other currencies, which seems very concerning to me. Real world currencies, as far as I know, don't behave this way unless an economy is collapsing.\n\nI think the only way Bitcoin would be sustainable is if there was more inflation, but the algorithms are designed to prevent this.\n\nI think a R\\^2 test against the null hypothesis might be a better calculation, but I'm not sure how to do this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Calculations**\n\nThe dollar/euro exchange rate from 1981-2021 has varied from around 0.63-1.54.

        "selftext": "(TL:DR at the bottom)\n\nThere has been a little debate here lately on whether the time spent using VTI/VXUS to buy the whole world market is worth it when you could save yourself a lot of time and trouble by just using VTWAX and be done with it. I did a little math here to help people decide for themselves. I\u2019m comparing VTI/VXUS against VTWAX (and not VT), because if your goal is truly is to do as little work as possible and forget about a few measly basis points, VTWAX represents keeping it simple in its purest form. If you can set up an auto deposit every month, you have literally zero work to do with VTWAX.\n\nHowever, if you want to do a little more work every month, the performance of VTWAX can be replicated exactly by looking up VTWAX\u2019s portfolio every month and seeing how much of their equities are US based vs. foreign based and buying the ETFs (VTI/VXUS) in the same proportions. (For the record, once you understand how to do all this, it should take you less than 15 minutes per month--it takes me closer to 10.)\n\nThe question I'm trying to answer is this: **Is that 15 minutes worth it?**\n\nI\u2019m trying to keep the math as simple as possible without it being so simplistic that it\u2019s meaningless. I have left out a lot of details (taxes on dividends, foreign tax credits, retirement accountants vs brokerages, ect.). If there is a consensus in the comments that suggests that my parameters are way off or if you think I\u2019ve left out parameters that would SIGNIFICANTLY skew the results one way or the other, I\u2019ll try to redo the math.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\nYour Initial Investment: $3000\n\nYour monthly contributions: $500\n\nYears you plan to invest: 30 years\n\nVTWAX\u2019s expense ratio: 0.1%\n\nVTI\u2019s expense ratio:  0.03%\n\nVXUS\u2019s expense ratio: 0.1%\n\nTotal expense ratio when you average 58% VTI and 42% VXUS: 0.051%\n\nBallpark Annual expected return on VTWAX: 7%\n\nBallpark Annual expected return on VTI/VXUS split: 7.051%\n\nMinutes it takes you to invest in VTWAX every month: 0\n\nMinutes it takes you to invest in VTI/VXUS every month: 15\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsing the simple Future Value function in Google sheets, the final balance of each account **after 30 years** are as follows:\n\n**VTWAX: $634,334.99**\n\n**VTI/VXUS: $640,753.06**\n\nOver 30 years, those measly 5 basis points have earned you an additional $6,547.19. Now, here comes the important question: was that extra 15 minute you spent every month to earn that $6,547.19 worth it?\n\nOver the course of those 30 years, those 15 minute chucks mean that you spent 90 hours working to earn $6,418.07. And that comes out to an hourly rate of $72.75.\n\n**TL:DR:** According to my very, very rough calculations, if you chose to spend 15 minutes every month looking up VT\u2019s portfolio balance and then buying the ETFs in those proportions instead using VTWAX, you are basically choosing to take a job that will take you 90 hours to finish and will pay you $72.75 per hour.\n\nI\u2019m willing to take that job. Therefore, I\u2019m taking the VTI/VXUS route.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nA couple people have wanted to take into account inflation. You can do one of two things here:\n\n1. You can optimistically assume that the 7% return I have here factors in inflation in which case the math is correct already. I'm skeptical, I really hope you are correct and we can expect 9% returns indefinitely.\n2. You can assume that the 7% return I'm estimating did not take into account inflation. If you would like to assume a 5% return (7%-a 2% inflation rate), than the final balances are VTWAX: $429,532.55, VTI/VXUS:$433,684.67. In this case, the hourly rate of your work in today's dollars is $46.13. So basically, imagine you will be making $46 per hour this year and you will be getting a 2% raise on that rate every year to compensate for inflation.",

Why has a certain Vanguard fund done so poorly today compared to the sector of the stock market it\u2019s tracking? \n\nThe answer: it\u2019s that time of the quarter when Vanguard\u2019s mutual funds and ETFs are going to start paying dividends again. \n\nFor example, the ex dividend date for VT is on Monday. The dividend will be $0.412 per share.\n\nThis means that the price of VT will drop by $0.412 because of the dividend in addition to whatever moves the market makes on that day. This means that if the global stock market is totally flat, you\u2019ll see a drop in the value of your holdings of VT by that amount. \n\nThat\u2019s ok, because you will receive a dividend in the amount of $0.412 per share on Thursday.

However, we are expecting a baby next year so this will likely go down some as we anticipate more expenses.\n\nMy understanding is that as long as we are getting at least a 3% return from our brokerage investments, it will always make more sense to send all extra cash there rather than paying down the principal of our mortgage.

        "selftext": "I can remember how I used to think about money before becoming a Boglehead, and looking back, I realize now how alien it seems to me now.\n\nSo I grew up in a household that never talked about investing. Ever. I wasn't encouraged to invest, I was never taught the value of investing, my parents never discussed investing in front of me... absolutely no interest in investing was ever on display. Not only did this inform my approach to investing, it also informed my approach to people with wealth (which neither of my parents were). It never occurred to me that patiently investing for decades\u2014specifically in low-cost index funds\u2014was a path to becoming wealthy. That that was an option for me. We just regarded wealthy individuals with an unspoken \"Good for them, but that's not happening for us.\" We approached investing as something we mutually agreed was beyond our understanding. There are people who can make investing work for them, and then there are people who cannot, and we were those who could not, and that was that. \n\nI personally thought this way a lot longer than I should have, and I know I'm far from alone in committing that error. I'm a Boglehead now, but I wanted to understand the major underlying reason why I wasn't before, and why many people are not. I speak for myself here, but I think this might be true of other people: **I did not actively want to consider the idea that my freedom was something I had to buy, and I did not want to actively conceive of myself as someone who isn't free.** Because if I do that, that means I have to look at myself as someone who is not free, and I have to look at the myriad of ways that I'm not free. I realize it was emotionally easier to delude myself into the idea that I am free as an excuse to look away from the reality that I am not free, and that becoming free is going to take patience, time, and unwavering commitment.\n\n**Boglehead philosophy is invaluable to me because it's the first time I was encouraged to think about the future value of money, and it's focused on being able to buy the most important thing: my freedom.** Once I grasped that, everything else fell into place for me emotionally, and I don't fall for many of the traps that I used to.\n\nFor example, I've seen the question posed: how do you emotionally handle the idea of the stock market dropping tomorrow and watching your net worth drop? That's easy: I remind myself that I'm not investing for tomorrow. I'm investing for a 30-40 year horizon. Therefore, regardless of what the stock market does tomorrow, the best time to buy low-cost index funds to provide for my future is still now.\n\nAnyway, my questions for you all: before you were a Boglehead, how did you used to think about money? Did your parents encourage you to see the value in investing, or is that something you had to learn on your own? Did you used to have a toxic relationship with money? If so, how?\n\n**EDIT:** Just want to thank everyone for their replies. Love seeing everybody's Boglehead origin stories!",

I did shift my portfolio from being 100% domestic to include international index funds at this point (not that it did any good).  \n\nNovember 2016: I thought Trump winning the 2016 election would tank the markets (actually it did briefly upset overnight futures markets). It didn't, of course. Rather, the market boomed. \n\nOctober 2017: I still remember the cover of The Economist. \"The bull market in everything\". I was sure that there was something afoot. There would be a few subsequent moments that felt like \"now it's about to start\". In February 2018 the VIX surged as the trade war accelerated and the Fed raised rates above 1%. There *was* (and this points to the difficulty of timing) a sharp correction in December 2018, but the market almost immediately recovered.    \n\nAugust 2019: the yield curve inverted, and once again I began to thought that the end was nigh. There was going to be a recession and that was it. The rise of the S&amp;P 500 into early 2020 felt suspicious to me. Arguably, this is the one time my gut might have been right. *But* I was right for the wrong reasons. The crash of 2020 was caused by the pandemic, which I obviously hadn't considered in August 2019 (nor even in January 2020). \n\nMarch 9, 2020: now, those were crazy times my friend. Some days were up double-digits and some were down by the same. It was circuit breaker city, man. Critically though, the signs of a financial crisis were there - repo markets were drying up and even treasuries were dropping.On March 9th I came damn close to shifting large amounts of my portfolio into bonds. I still have the trade confirmation, though I stopped it at the last second. The S&amp;P 500 had fallen to something like 2800.  \n\nApril 9, 2020: I held through the bottom, when a strange thing started happening. The market recovered very rapidly. In a few days the S&amp;P 500 was up from a low of something in the 2200s to almost 2800. I thought there was no way it could keep going like this. I remember looking at graphs (which people were posting widely at the time) showing the market through the Great Depression. One of the striking takeaways was that it hadn't just been down down down followed by recovery. There were so many bear traps. Could this be one of them? It was at this point that I broke from Bogle advice. As the market recovered, I shifted modest amounts into bonds reasoning that when the real bottom appeared I would buy everything cheap. A completely irrational factor in my move: relatives bragging that they saw the crash coming and pulled everything out just in time. \n\n June 6, 2020: as my fear of bear traps receded, I reverted back to my long-term optimal portfolio. One day later, the market saw the biggest crash since the heady days of March. A-ha! I thought. It turns out I was right all along. And *of course* I was - unemployment had just hit the highest levels since the Great Depression, some states were prematurely reopening from the pandemic, etc. I didn't sell everything, but I maintained an overly bond-heavy portfolio for my age (mid-30s). As the market rose further in July and August, I continued to shift assets to bonds (I also shifted my bond holdings to TIPS which did work out... so far). \n\n September 2020: through August I had read the story about Softbank's sometimes insane bets on tech, and was again sure that a crash was nigh. I felt bearish - one day I went running in the woods and literally saw a family of black bears crossing the road. And indeed, the S&amp;P 500 started to correct (the Nasdaq somewhat more). And yet... pretty soon after, it was back to normal. \n\nJanuary 22, 2021: this story involves my active trading account, which represents a very small proportion of my investments. When GME started to surge to $65 (vs. $4 in August 2020) following the beginnings of the campaign on Wall Street Bets, I was sure that the stock would fall. I bought OTM puts. When it rose more, I bought more OTM puts - and I even was able to time the peak correctly the second time. Obviously, the first set of puts became worthless, but interestingly, so did the second because I had bought them when volatility was so high that the stock would have to hit ridiculously low levels for my puts to print.      \n\n\nI'm sure that there are other folks out there who are better investors than I. Maybe they have the time to do research and find diamonds in the rough. Maybe they have the discipline to avoid going double or nothing (and to resist confirmation bias) when their theses prove false. And hey, maybe they are smarter and possessed of some abilities that I lack. But I would have to say that the smartest thing I've ever done is to ignore my instincts, saved, diversified, and waited.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve tried approaching the following decision analytically but am checking if others have experienced similar decisions or can see any of my blind spots.\n\nI have a pretty high savings rate and hate to leave my dollars working inefficiently. The more I save, the quicker I can reach financial independence. In my 20\u2019s I\u2019ve stayed in 100% stocks and have not purchased any bonds. I have a pretty tough skin and risk tolerance and didn\u2019t even consider selling during the short 2020 market crash.\n\nHowever, I also understand the importance of an emergency fund. I started with around $10,000 in an Ally savings account and have increased it up to $25,000 over the past few years.\n\nMore recently, I\u2019ve considered putting most of my emergency fund into I-bonds. I understand they are less liquid than a savings account but in the long run will be less affected by inflation. Looking at historic rates, they almost always are at least 1-2% higher than a high yield savings account.  https://imgur.com/a/agSHRni\n\nThe pro to an online savings account is only liquidity and money available within a few days. \n\nFrom what I can tell about I-bonds the pros and cons are:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Higher Inflation Protected Interest Rates\n\nCons:\n\n1. Locked up for 1 year from time of purchase.\n\n2. Forfeit 3 months interest if redeemed within 5 years\n\n3. Limited to $10,000 purchased per year \n\n4. May take longer to redeem in an emergency \n\nI think I can deal with all of the cons in my current situation. If I purchase 10k this year and 10k towards the end of next year I could limit my exposure to liquidity issues. My plan would be to buy 10k this December, bring my emergency fund savings account back to 20k by next December, then buy 10k more. At that point I would have 20k in I-bonds and 10k in a savings account. Ideally for small emergencies I wouldn\u2019t even have to touch the I-bonds. Even sacrificing 3 months of interest after 1 year I would still be ahead relative to a high yield savings account. 9 months at an I bond rate beats 12 months at current savings accounts rates.\n\nIn the short term, 15k liquidity is plenty. I have a local safety net and could both cover a 6-month lease liability ($3750) and the maximum out of pocket for health insurance ($6500). Worst case I could also move back in with parents and just pay for partial utilities and food. My current industry also has a pretty high demand so it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to get another similar paying job.\n\nOne of my main concerns is how difficult it is in practice to redeem I-bonds. Could I put a large emergency expense on a credit card, cash in the same amount of electronic I-bonds the same day, and be able to pay off the credit card within 3 weeks?",

They will in all cases give basic, known information such as: \"America has long been the center of corporate innovation, and maintains a business friendly environment regardless of political party, whereas China is becoming increasingly controlling of their market.\" Or ESG folks will say, \"Fossil fuel consumption is down across the board, and solar energy is now cost competitive or cost superior in most areas of the globe.\" This is day-one minute-one basic information for any institutional investor or fund manager. Since they all know that the risk of Chinese stock is higher than the risk of American stock, then they will demand a lower price and therefore a higher expected return to take on that risk.\n\nSo, if you are tempted to believe USA stock is safer and less risky due to it's superior environment, or sector positioning, or technological foundation, or whatever, then the next words out of your mouth should be, \"and that's why USA stock is expensive and I expect it to underperform.\"",

I\u2019m sure that data is somewhere in the app, but not as cleanly and easily accessible as it was with the thumb/hold/slide feature of the last app. Bummer. \n\n\nThat\u2019s all",

It's because of what I tell myself each time I buy. I mentally promise not to sell the newly acquired stock until 1 year has passed since its purchase. I back this up by thinking 1 year is what it takes for long-term capital gains tax to kick in. Although I don't plan on selling anything for many years, that concept of waiting at least 1 year after each purchase makes me feel very indifferent to whatever happens shortly after I buy in and has allowed me to do it whenever I have money, not when I feel the price is low enough",

        "selftext": "# Intelligent Investor\n\n- An investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Anything else is speculation.\n- Speculators attitude toward stock market movements lies in trying to anticipate and profit from market fluctuations.\n- Investor&amp;#39;s primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices.\n- Unintelligent speculation is speculation when you think you are investing, any trades done on margin, doing it seriously instead of a pastime, risking more than you can afford to lose.\n- If you are going to speculate, put a small amount aside and don&amp;#39;t add money because you are up. Understand that you in fact are speculating and be prepared to lose.\n- An investor cannot hope for better than average results by buying IPOs or &amp;quot;Hot&amp;quot; stocks\n- Defensive Investor \u2013 Interested in safety and freedom from bother. Purchase investment funds vs creating a stock portfolio, use investment counsel firm, or dollar-cost average.\n- Aggressive Investor \u2013 To enjoy a reasonable chance of success, the investor must follow policies which are sound and promising and are NOT popular on Wall Street.\n- You must be either a defensive/conservative investor or an aggressive/enterprising investor. You can&amp;#39;t be 50/50.\n- Speculative stock movements are carried too far in both directions.\n- Savings Accounts can also be a good choice in lieu of bonds.\n- Do NOT buy on margin. You are speculating.\n- If the investors funds are placed into high grade short maturity bonds (\\&amp;lt;7 years), he will not be affected by market prices.\n- Longer term bonds and equities will vary during his lifetime and he must be prepared for this.\n- Investment of most intelligent when it is most businesslike.\n\nDefensive Investor\n\n- Preferred Stocks are not usually a good investment. It carries no share in the company&amp;#39;s profits beyond a fixed dividend. Thus the preferred holder lacks both the legal claim of a bondholder (Creditor) and the profit possibilities of a common stockholder (Partner). You are dependent on the ability and desire of the company to pay dividends on its common stock. They are under no obligation to pay you unless they pay the common shareholder. This investment vehicle is better for corporations.\n- The choice of a corporate bond vs tax free municipal bond is made by the tax rate payed by the individual. Example \u2013 If a municipal pays 30% less than a corporate bond. The investor was at a tax bracket above 30% he would have a net saving by choosing the municipal bond. The opposite is true if the tax was below 30%. Usually tax-free bonds are better for individuals in high tax brackets.\n- Only invest in high quality bonds \u2013 AAA, AA, A. Do NOT invest in lower quality (2nd grade) issues to get a higher return. Stay away from high yield &amp;quot;Junk Bonds&amp;quot;\n- Rules for Defensive Common Stock Component \u2013 A. Adequate diversification but not excessive B. Company should be large, prominent, and conservatively financed C. Long record of dividend payments D. Have a limit on the price willing to pay. Say 25x average earnings over the last 7 years.\n- Defensive investors should usually stay away from Growth Stocks.\n- One of the most persuasive test of high quality is uninterrupted record of dividend payments for the last 20 years or more. The defensive investor might be justified in limiting his purchases to those.\n- Stock Selection \u2013 Adequate size, strong financial condition (Current ratio 2/1), positive earnings for the past 10 years, uninterrupted dividends for the past 20 years, EPS growth of at least 33% in the past 10 years, P/E of less than 15 for the last 3 years earnings, current price not more than 1.5x book value\n- Short vs Long Maturity Bonds \u2013 if the investor wants to assure himself against a decline in the principal of his bond but at the cost of a lower annual yield and loss of possibility of a gain in principal, pick short maturity bonds.\n- It might be best for the conservative investor to concentrate on issues selling at a close approx. to their tangible asset value (book value). Say not more than 1/3 above that figure. Consider this a premium an extra fee paid for the advantage of a stock exchange listing and ability to quickly sell/buy.\n- But just because a stock is selling for its book value doesn&amp;#39;t make it a good investment. The investor should demand a satisfactory P/E ratio, strong financial position, and the prospect that its earnings will at least be maintained over the year.\n- The risk of paying too high a price for good quality issues is not the chief hazard confronting the average invest. Observation is that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase of low quality issues at times of favorable business conditions.\n\nAggressive Investor\n\n- Growth Stock \u2013 one which has increased their per share earnings in the past at well above the rate for common stocks and is generally expected to continue to do so.\n- Growth stocks have 2 problems \u2013 Growth stocks with good records and apparently good prospects sell at correspondingly high prices. The investor maybe right in his judgement of the prospects and still not do well. Merely because he overpaid for the expected prosperity. The 2nd is his judgment as the future may prove wrong. Rapid growth can&amp;#39;t last forever.\n- Stay away from IPO&amp;#39;s/Common stock offerings. They tend to be offered in &amp;quot;favorable&amp;quot; market conditions for the sellers, not the buyers.\n- The habit of the market is to overvalue common stocks which have been showing excellent growth, but it will also undervalue companies that are out of favor because unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature.\n- If looking at growth companies, concentrate on the larger companies that are going through a period of unpopularity. Smaller companies don&amp;#39;t have the resources to withstand the storm and the market is slower to react to improvement vs larger companies.\n- 2 major sources of undervaluation. A. currently disappointing results and B. unpopularity. But make sure these are temporary and not permanent.\n- The investor should require an indication of at least reasonable stability of earnings over the past decade. No years of earnings deficit plus size and strength to meet possible setbacks. The ideal combination here is that of a large and prominent company selling both well below its past average price and its past average P/E ratio.\n- Secondary Company \u2013 one that is not a leader in a fairly important industry. They tend to be undervalued at all times. Buy them only when they are at &amp;quot;Bargain&amp;quot; prices. Bargain being a stock that has an indicated value 50% above the share price.\n- Ways to profit from secondary buys. A. The dividends are relatively high. B. The reinvested earnings are high relative to price paid and will affect the price. C. A bull market is most generous to lower priced issues. D. Smaller companies may be acquired by larger.\n- The broadest category of investments for the enterprising investor are undervalued stocks of secondary issues. Invest in these only when they can be bought at 2/3 or less of indicated value.\n- Market Fluctuations\n- 2 ways to profit from pendulum swings in the market A. Timing \u2013 anticipate the direction of the market and buy/sell accordingly (Very Difficult to do). B. Pricing \u2013 buying or selling when the stock are quoted above or below fair value. You may do dollar cost averaging when the market is fair value or undervalued to replicate this strategy.\n- A less ambitious form of pricing is the simple effort that you do not pay too much for your stocks. This may work for the defensive investor who is planning on holding long term. You can dollar cost average during fair or low value markets.\n- Bull Market Signs \u2013 Historically high price levels, high P/E ratios, low dividend yields against bond yields, speculation on margin, lots of public offerings of low quality stocks.\n- The more successful a company, the more likely its price will fluctuate widely. Secondary issues will also fluctuate more widely than major ones.\n- Never buy a stock because it has gone up or sell because it has gone down.\n- The speculators primary interest lie in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations. The investor&amp;#39;s primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at good prices.\n- Buy-Low Sell High \u2013 very difficult to do, so instead increase the proportion of bonds in your portfolio during bull markets and reduce the common stock element. Say 75B/25S during bull markets and 25B/75S during bear and 50/50 during fair value. This allows the investor to feel as if they are doing something and to prevent you from following the crowd.",

But we\u2019ve got those covered.\n\n&gt; Looking at the first, the 500 largest stocks in the U.S. make up about 80% of VTSAX. The largest of these 500 are all international businesses, many of which generate 50% or more of their sales and profits overseas. Companies like Apple, GE, Microsoft, Exxon/Mobil, Berkshire Hathaway, Caterpillar, Coca-Cola and Ford to name a few. \n\n&gt; Since these companies provide solid access to the growth of world markets\u2014while filtering out most of the additional risk\u2014I don\u2019t feel the need to invest further in international-specific funds. \n\n&gt; The second frequently cited reason is the expectation that the performance of international markets will not be correlated with that of the U.S. That is to say, when one is up the other might be down. The idea is having them as part of your asset allocation helps smooth the ride and offers the prospect of enhanced returns through reallocations. The problem is, as world economies become ever more closely knit together, this variation in the performance of their markets fades. While there will always be exceptions due to geopolitical events, world markets are becoming increasingly more correlated.\n\nHe goes on to recommend Vanguard mutual funds that cover international stocks if you still don't agree with his take, but I want to hear from other Bogleheads regarding their thoughts on how strong or weak this reasoning is.",

I don't want to get too hung up on the specifics but I've tried to make it plausible.\n\nToday, an investor sets up a perpetual trust (aka a [dynasty trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_trust)) and funds it with $10,000,000. This is near the maximum you could put in without triggering a tax event. It's certainly a lot of money, but it is less than the net worth of the top 1% of US households. So there at least a million investors in the US that *could* do this, and tens of thousands that could do it *easily*.\n\nThe trust is invested 100% in a broad equity index. All the money is kept in for 250 years.\n\nThat's a very long time, but only 4 or 5 times the investment horizon of a young investor today.\n\nWhat will the trust be able to do with that money? Obviously it depends on the real return rate. \n\n* At just over 6% it could buy all the real estate in the US.\n* At 7% it would be able to buy all real estate on Earth.\n* At 8% it would be able to buy all real estate on Earth *every year without touching the principle.*\n\nEven at 5% it would pass \"buy the world\" levels of wealth in 365 years (Nevada's limit for perpetual trusts). \n\nThis doesn't seem right, and I don't mean from a wealth inequality standpoint.

The risks go far beyond what we are used to dealing with in regulated market securities. like volatility or bankruptcy risk or interest rate risk. Crypto exposes you to non-market risks such as losing the keys necessary to claim your ownership of the tokens, having your tokens stolen by hackers or the operators of the exchange holding them, or having your tokens on an exchange seized by government agencies. All of these have already occurred on multiple occasions. And then there is the largest risk of all. In a very real sense, crypto tokens are already bankrupt. They have a literal value of nothing, they have a future value of nothing. Thus their price depends entirely on whether enough people are willing to ignore this fact and exchange real money for nothing.

        "selftext": "Nassim Taleb\n\n# **Fooled by Randomness**\n\n- Survivorship Bias means you don&amp;#39;t hear from the losers on a topic, you only hear from the winners.\n  - Watch out judging a person by their results because history will only show you the winners. You won&amp;#39;t hear the stories of the losers\n- Over short terms, you see variance, not returns. Don&amp;#39;t monitor your portfolio on a daily basis\n- AFTER an event has occurred, it is easy to make a story as to why it happened and why people should have seen it. But it is difficult to see in advance BEFORE it happens\n  - Events are more random than we think\n- Negative pangs cause a 2.5x more emotional response than a positive one\n- It is not how likely an event is to happen that matters, it is how much is made or lost when it happens that should be the consideration\n  - Maximize your profit expectancy, not probability\n- I try to benefit from &amp;quot;rare events&amp;quot;, events that do not tend to repeat themselves frequently\n- I believe that rare events are not fairly valued, and that the rarer the event, the more undervalued it will be in price\n- Investors for pure emotional reasons, will be drawn into strategies that experience rare but large variations.\n- Pascal&amp;#39;s Wager \u2013 The optimal strategy for humans is to believe in God because if God does exist the believer will be rewarded and if he doesn&amp;#39;t exist, the believer has nothing to lose.\n  - IE - Inequality of outcomes, don&amp;#39;t try to pick up nickels in front of a train\n- There is no point in searching for patterns that are available to everyone; once detected, they would be self-canceling\n- &amp;quot;One cannot judge a performance in any given field by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e. if history played out in a different way). Such substitutes courses of events are called alternative histories. Cleary the quality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on its outcome.\n- Past events will always look less random than they were (hindsight bias)\n- Probability almost never presents itself as a mathematical problem or brain teaser\n- No one accepts randomness in their success, only in their failure\n- Take into account the costs of mistakes\n- Bad information is worse than no information at all\n- 5 traits of a Market Fool\n  - Overestimating accuracy of data or overconfidence\n  - Getting married to positions\n  - Changing story\n  - No plans for taking losses or exit strategy\n  - Denial of luck and randomness\n\n# **The Black Swan**\n\n- 3 attributes for a black swan\n  - A black swan is an outlier, as in outside the realm of regular expectations\n  - Carries extreme impact\n  - Human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence _ **after** _ the fact\n    - Rare, Extreme Impact and Retrospective predictability\n- There are great problems with trying to forecast the future, given limited knowledge of the past\n- Black swans being unpredictable, we need to adjust to their existence rather than naively try to predict them\n- The human mind suffers from 3 ailments as it comes into contact with history\n  - The illusion of understanding or how everyone thinks they know what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize\n  - Retrospective distortion or how we assess matter only after the fact (history seems clearer and more organized in books than in empirical reality)\n  - Overvaluation of factual information\n- Taleb realized that he was totally incapable of predicting market prices, but that others were just as incapable as him but did not know it or did not know that they were taking massive risks. Most traders were just picking up pennies in front of a steamroller\n- 2 types of randomness analogy\n  - Mediocristan \u2013 land of average\n  - Extremistan \u2013 land of black swans\n    - Mediocristan - When your sample is large; no single instance will significantly change the aggregate or total. The largest observation will remain impressive, but insignificant to the sum. IE \u2013 Human weights, Human heights, car accidents, IQ\n      - Black swans don&amp;#39;t occur here. Once you collect enough data should reveal all you need to know and if you do have a surprise, it won&amp;#39;t be consequential. Collecting data here is ok. What you can learn from data in Mediocristan augments very rapidly with the supply of information. You can predict here.\n    - Extemistan \u2013 inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate or the total. IE \u2013 wealth, income, book sales per author, financial markets, commodity prices, inflation rates, economic data\n      - Black swans do occur here. You will have trouble figuring out the average from any sample since it can depend so much on one single observation. Be suspicious of the knowledge of the data you collect here. Knowledge here grows slowly and erratically with the addition of data. Difficult or even impossible to predict.\n- Black Swan Example \u2013 Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird&amp;#39;s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly humans &amp;quot;looking out for my best interests&amp;quot;. But the Wednesday before Thanksgiving something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will occur a revision of belief. Ironically, the turkeys feeling of safety had reached a maximum when the risk was the highest.\n  - The turkey had &amp;quot;learned backwards&amp;quot; from observation\n  - oHow can we know the future, given finite knowledge of the past?\n  - Something may have worked in the past until, well it doesn&amp;#39;t. You don&amp;#39;t drive your car looking in the rear-view mirror.\n    - Before 1987, the biggest single day drop in the Dow was 13% so some people incorrectly concluded from the past that they most the Dow could drop in a day was 13%. It dropped 22% on &amp;quot;Black Monday&amp;quot;\n- Positive Black Swans take time to show their effects while negative black swans happen very quickly\n- Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\n- Na\u00efve Empiricism \u2013 We tend to have a tendency to look for instances that confirm our story and our vision of the world and these instances are easy to find. You take past instances that corroborate your theories and treat them as evidence.\n- Negative Empiricism - The way to counter your Na\u00efve Empiricism is to understand that a series of corroborative facts is not _Necessarily_ evidence.\n  - Seeing White Swans does not confirm the nonexistence of Black Swans.\n- The error of confirmation - We are quick to draw conclusions from what we have seen to what is unseen.\n- Confirmation Bias \u2013 our natural tendency to look only for corroboration of our ideas.\n  - To counter this George Soros was known when taking a financial bet to keep looking for evidence or instances to prove his initial theory wrong\n- Narrative Fallacy \u2013 this is associated with our vulnerability to overinterpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. It severely distorts our mental representation of the world, especially rare events\n  - We tend to look at sequences of facts and weave them into an explanation. Explanations bind these facts together. Making them easy to remember. They help us make more sense of the facts. Because our brains can&amp;#39;t store all that information. Stories stick, statistics don&amp;#39;t\n    - The more you summarize, the more order you put in, the less randomness. The same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random that it actually is.\n- In some strategies, you gamble dollars to win a succession of pennies while appearing to be winning all the time. In other strategies, you risk a succession of pennies to win dollars. In other words, you bet either that the black swan will or won&amp;#39;t happen. These require completely different mind sets.\n  - Most people have a preference for number 1\n  - Some bets in which one wins big but infrequently, yet loses small but frequently, are worth making if others are suckers for them and if you have the personal and intellectual stamina\n- We favor the narrated. We are not manufactured to understand abstract matters, we need context. Randomness and uncertainty are abstractions. We respect what has happened, ignoring what could have happened.\n- Our ideas are sticky: once we produce a theory, we are not likely to change our minds. When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions. So those who delay developing their theories are better off\n- We humans are the victims of an asymmetry in the perception of random events. We attribute our success to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control, namely to randomness. We feel responsible for the good, but not for the bad.\n- Taleb&amp;#39;s Perfect World \u2013 &amp;quot;Think of someone heavily introspective, tortured by the awareness of his own ignorance. He lacks the courage of the idiot, yet has the rare guts to say &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot; He does not mind looking like a fool. He hesitates, he will not commit, and he agonizes over the consequences of being wrong. He introspects, introspects, and introspects until he reaches physical and mental exhaustion. This does not mean he lacks confidence, only that he holds his own knowledge to be suspect.\n- Louis Pasteur \u2013 &amp;quot;Luck favors the prepared&amp;quot;\n- The black swan asymmetry allows you to be confident about what is wrong, not about what you believe is right\n- So, what to do if you can&amp;#39;t predict in a world with Black Swans??\n  - Avoid unnecessary dependence on large scale harmful predictions. Be fooled in small matters, not large. Example \u2013 don&amp;#39;t accept the government forecast for SS payments 50 years from now.\n  - Do not listen to economic forecasters or to predictions\n  - Be prepared! Be prepared for all relevant eventualities\n  - People are often ashamed of losses, so they engage in strategies that produce very little volatility but contain the risk of large loss.\n  - Barbell Strategy\n    - Be as hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive and you can instead of being mildly aggressive or conservative\n    - Put 80-90% in extremely safe investments \u2013 (Example \u2013 T-Bills)\n    - Put the other 10-20% in extremely speculative investments (Example \u2013 VC)\n    - You have no risk on one side and high risk on the other, which equals out to medium risk. This minimizes your risk of negative black swans and exposures you to positive black swans\n    - Put yourself in situations where favorable consequences are much larger than unfavorable ones\n    - I am very aggressive when I can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative when I am under threat from a negative Black Swan\n\n# **Anti-Fragile**\n\n- Fragile-Robust-Antifragile. Fragile wants tranquility, Antifragile grows from disorder and robust doesn&amp;#39;t care too much\n- Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. This is Antifragile. The opposite is fragile\n- Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets stronger\n- I would rather be dumb and antifragile than smart and fragile\n  - It is much easier to figure out if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it.\n- Asymmetry: anything that has more upside than downside from random events is antifragile; the reverse is fragile\n- Fragile needs to be very predictive in its approach, and conversely, predictive systems cause fragility\n- For the economy to be antifragile as a whole, individual companies must be fragile. We don&amp;#39;t have this currently\n  - Many government interventions and social policies end up hurting the weak and consolidating the established\n- We are fragilizing social and economic systems by denying them stressors and randomness\n- We make social, political (and other) systems vulnerable to Black Swans when we over stabilize them\n- The problem with artificially suppressed volatility is not just that the system tends to become extremely fragile; it is that, at the same time, it exhibits no visible risks. They become prone to black swan events\n- Attempts at eliminating the business cycle led to more fragile economic systems (IE \u2013 The Greenspan Put)\n  - Part of this is due to the fact it is easier to sell &amp;quot;Look what I did for you&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;Look what I avoided for you.&amp;quot;\n- Our track record in figuring out significant rare events in politics and economics is about zero\n- What makes life simple is that the robust and antifragile don&amp;#39;t have to have as accurate a comprehension of the world as the fragile, and they do not need to forecast\n  - A person with extra cash in the bank and stockpiles of tradeable goods and gold bars doesn&amp;#39;t need to forecast correctly.\n  - People in debt are fragile and need a lot more forecasting ability\n- There are 2 types of domains\n  - Those we can somewhat predict. IE \u2013 The physical like planet motions\n  - Those that we cannot. IE - The Black Swan \u2013 Social, Economic, and Cultural life\n- The first step toward antifragility consists in first decreasing downside, rather than increasing upside. That means lowering exposure to negative black swans\n- What matters is the route taken, the order of events, not just the destination \u2013 what scientists call path-dependent property\n  - Example \u2013 A kidney stone operation and anesthesia after is very different than the opposite\n- People miss the strong logical precedence of survival over success\n- In other words, if something is fragile, its risk of breaking make anything you do to improve it or make it &amp;quot;efficient&amp;quot; inconsequential unless you first reduce that risk of breaking\n- Barbell Strategy or Bimodal Strategy\n  - Combination of 2 extreme areas with nothing in the middle\n    - Playing it safe in some areas \u2013 robust to black swans\n    - Taking a lot of small risks in other \u2013 open to positive black swans\n      - The whole then becomes antifragile\n- The causes extreme risk aversion on one side and extreme risk loving on the other\n  - But the barbell also results, because of its construction, in the reduction of downside risk \u2013 the elimination of the risk of ruin\n- Antifragility is the combination aggressiveness plus paranoia, protect your downside from extreme harm, and let the upside take care of itself\n- Yiddish proverb &amp;quot;Provide for the worst; the best can take care of itself.&amp;quot;\n  - Many people tend to provide for the best and hope the worst takes care of itself\n- Example of above\n  - People find insuring their house a necessity, not something to be judged against a financial strategy, but when it comes to their portfolios, because of the way things are framed in the press, they don&amp;#39;t look at them the same way.\n  - They think that the barbell strategy needs to be examined for its potential return as an investment. That is NOT the point. The barbell is simply an idea of insurance of survival\n- When you are fragile, you need to know a lot more than when you are antifragile. Conversely, when you think you know more than you do, you are fragile to error.\n  - Overconfidence leads to reliance on forecasts, which causes borrowing, then to the fragility of leverage. Example \u2013 Long Term Capital Management (LTCM)\n- Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\n- Much of what other people know isn&amp;#39;t worth knowing\n- Non-linear means that the response is not straightforward and not in a straight line, so if you double say, the dose, you get a lot more or a lot less than double the effect.\n- For the fragile, shocks bring higher and higher harm as their intensity increases (up to a point)\n  - Example \u2013 Falling from a height of 30ft one time brings more than 30 times the harm of falling 30 times from a height of 1ft\n- What is fragile is something that is both unbroken and subjected to nonlinear effects\n- The fragile is hurt a lot more by extreme events than by a succession of intermediate ones\n- For the antifragile, shocks bring more benefits as their intensity increases (up to a point)\n  - Example \u2013 powerlifters get more benefits lifting 300 lbs one time than 1 lb 300 times\n    - Every additional pound brings more benefits, until one gets close to the limit, what would be known as &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot;\n- Convexity effect analogy (Positive and Negative) Think of a smile (+) and frown (-)\n  - Positive \u2013 Convex \u2013 Think Happy face - Gain more than pain. Likes volatility. If for a given variation, you have more upside than downside, it will be convex (slopes up)\n  - Negative - Concave \u2013 Think Sad face \u2013 Pain more than gain. Dislikes volatility. If for a given variation, you have more downside than upside, it will be concave (slopes down). The more harm from the unexpected. Large deviations have a disproportionately larger and larger effect (acceleration)\n- The inverse philosophers stone or how to detect fragility\n  - Figure out if our miscalculations or mis forecasts are on balance more harmful than they are beneficial, and how accelerating the damage will be.\n    - You don&amp;#39;t have to be exact with this measurement. You can get a scale that isn&amp;#39;t zeroed and know if you are gaining or losing weight. I can have a non-exact ruler and know if my child is growing or not.\n  - Example \u2013 Government deficits are particularly concave to changes in economic conditions. Every additional deviation in, say, the unemployment rate, particularly when the government has debt, makes deficits incrementally worse.\n  - Financial leverage for a company has the same effect: you need to borrow more and more to get the same result\n- Average (First order effects) do not matter\n  - &amp;quot;Do not cross a river if it is on average 4ft deep&amp;quot;\n  - Analogy \u2013 You grandmother will spend the next 2 hours at 70 degrees (Perfect Grandmother Temp).\n    - But there is also a second point of the data \u2013 she will spend the first hour at 0 and the 2nd hour at 140 for an average of 70\n    - Temp changes become more and more harmful as they deviate from 70. And the 2nd piece of information, the variability, turned out to be more important than the first.\n  - Point of above \u2013 The notion of average is of no significance when one is fragile to variations\n    - Grandmother is non-linear to temperature (response is not a straight line), it curves inward (concave), the more nonlinear the response, the less relevant the average\n- Many people are drawn to financial markets because we hear or see the success, but the failures are buried and we don&amp;#39;t hear about them",

        "selftext": "&gt; \u201cShort-term risk, occurring over periods of less than several years, is what we feel in our guts as we follow the market from day to day, and month to month. It is what gives investors sleepless nights. More importantly, it is what causes investors to bail out of stocks after a bad run, usually at the bottom. And yet, in the long-term, it is of trivial importance. After all, if you can obtain high long-term returns, what does it matter if you have lost and regained 50% or 80% of your principal along the way?\n\n\n&gt; This, of course, is easier said than done. Even the most disciplined of investors exited the markets in the 1930s, never to return. Obsession with the short-term returns ingrained in human nature; the impulse is impossible to ignore. Your short-term investing emotions must be recognized and dealt with on their own terms. It is an easy thing to look at the above data and convince yourself that you will be able to stay the course through the tough times.\n\n\n&gt; But actually doing it is an entirely different affair. Examining historical returns and imagining losing 50% or 80% of your capital is like practicing an airplane crash in a simulator. Trust me, there is a big difference between how you\u2019ll behave in the simulator and how you\u2019ll perform during the real thing. During bull markets, everyone believes that they\u2019re committed to stocks for the long term.

        "selftext": "A frequent question that comes up often in this subreddit is, \"The US has trounced Ex-US for the past decade. Why do I need to even bother investing internationally?\" With this post, I'd like to propose an answer to this question -- and to avoid having to repeat myself in comments.\n\nMy main issue with this question is that US versus Ex-US isn't an apples-to-apples comparison. In statistician-speak, you're essentially looking at a single probability distribution versus a joint probability distribution.\n\nWhy is this a problem? When you combine multiple probability distributions, the resulting joint probability distribution tends to decrease in variance and form around some common mean. (See also: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central\\_limit\\_theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem))\n\nTurning to stock returns (I'm simplifying here), each country's stock market returns is in essence a single probability distribution. Generally, stock market returns are highly skewed and have high variance, with the best days for returns being concentrated in just a few instances. (This is why everyone says don't try to time the market.)\n\nNow, what do you think would happen, if we combined all these individual probability distributions representing individual countries' stock market returns together? Obviously, the resulting joint probability distribution in general would have lower skew and variance, and thereby smoothing out extreme positive or negative outcomes.\n\nTo put this in perspective, the best developed market to have invested in over the past twenty years *was not the US*. It was *Denmark*. That's right: Denmark. The Danish stock market returned 11.7%, compared to the US' paltry 7.0% over that time period. (Source: [https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/which-country-will-outperform-next-is-irrelevant/](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/which-country-will-outperform-next-is-irrelevant/)). Had you invested $100k in 2001 in Denmark, that money would now be over $900k, compared to less than $400k in the US. (The Danish market beat the US last year and did not too badly relative to the US over the past 5 and 10 years either.)\n\nDid you notice that the Danish stock market had a such great returns for so long? Unless you were keeping close tabs on the Nasdaq Copenhagen index (which face it, very, very few of you were), you wouldn't have noticed. This is because the Danish stock market returns were blended into the overall \"ex-US\" market in your VXUS ETF or VTIAX mutual fund. We should not be surprised by seeing a highly skewed outcome with individual countries, as we are currently observing with the US stock market.\n\nAnyone can easily pick individual countries' stock markets *post hoc.* You can now buy ETFs for individual countries' stock market, if you really wanted to. (Denmark's is $EDEN.) But I personally don't have confidence in my stock or country picking abilities, so I invest globally.\n\nAnyhow, this is my proposal to answer this perennial question. Please feel free to point out anything that is wrong with my line of thinking, but do note that I'm some random person on Reddit and I've made many simplifications here.",

While there might be genuine reasons to do so, **let's not fool ourselves into believing that we are fundamentally different from folks who were investing 10, 20 or 30 years ago.**\n\nWhen we are building a ship and planning to keep afloat in storms, we don't say to ourselves that we will *just act differently* than others when the storm comes. We build a *better* ship that will improve our chances to withstand a storm when it comes. Your portfolio is that ship. Invest some time now to build a better balanced portfolio, rather than just relying on your guts to *do the right thing*.\n\nImagine this: When the stock market is crashing for 3-5 years, and everyone is saying that this time it is different, **it's extremely hard to stay the course**. You can tell yourself, \"Oh, I'm a long-term investor\". But, 2 years later, everyone around you who sold all their stocks is doing extremely well, and you are sitting on huge losses, it is hard to not start doubting yourself and everything you believe in. Experts and other bogleheads are saying for 2 years+ that you should not assume the previous lessons apply anymore, and they have been right for the last 3-5 years. It is extreme hard to ignore all that. **Many folks before you doubted themselves, and you are very likely to do so in the same circumstances**. \n\nAll the posts I'm seeing right now are typical and all this has happened before. Many of us **will** not stay the course when the next big crash comes - it is inevitable. When fund managers with their PhDs in finance who are investing \"someone else's money\" are not immune; we who are investing **our hard earned money** are definitely not immune. \n\nIf you are not convinced, try a thought experiment: We know that expected returns for Intl are higher than US. How many of us will have the nerves right now to increase Intl stock allocation (I don't). How about 100% Intl? I could make the same argument for SCV as well. 10-15years ago many folks were doing 100% SCV. Where are they now? (**To be clear, I am not suggesting anyone hold 100% Intl or 100% SCV).**  \n\nRight now is a great time to build a better \"ship\" rather than doing it when you are already in a \"storm\". Right now is a great time to re-read classic books on portfolio theory. Please, don't hold 100% US based on recent performance and reliance on your guts and knowledge. Add some Intl (at least 20%), add some bonds (at least 20-25%), **especially if you started investing after 2009**. Please don't just try to maximize return based on 10 years of history; please take a look at your portfolio's risk &amp; uncertainty, and try to control it as well.\n\nAnd, remember, all of us are average, on average :-).",

        "title": "With Federal Student Loan Repayment Starting in January, Should We Pay Off Student Loans or Refinance/Invest the Cash We've Been Hoarding During Pandemic?",
        "selftext": "**TL;DR**: Wife and I have been hoarding cash during pandemic waiting for Biden/Congress to do something on student loans. Well, D-Day (01/31/2022) is fast approaching and nothing is happening, so it's about go-time to make a decision. Do I just pay these off and move on with life or refinance, max 2021/2022 Roths for both wife and me, max Solo 401k at beginning of 2022, etc?\n\n**Background**: Wife and I (both 34 years old, with two kids) had approximately $220k in student loan debt when we started dated in 2014. Hers were private loans so we paid them off first ($70k). I paid mine down to $104k and then the pandemic happened, freezing all federal student loan payments. Since then I have been hoarding cash to pay them off.\n\n**Loan Info**: All federal loans with an average interest rate of 6.1%. I can refinance to approximately 2.5% and a lot of these refinance companies are offering a $1,000 refinance bonus, rendering the effective interest rate even lower.\n\n**Basic Net Worth Numbers**\n\n* Cash: $141k\n* Retirement Accounts: $286k (all invested in index funds)\n* Home Value (Zillow Estimate): $365k\n* Mortgage: $240k\n* Student Loan Debt: $104k\n* No Credit Card Debt\n* No Car Loans\n* Net Worth: $448k\n\n**Income**\n\n* Wife: $40k/year\n   * Has 401k (will max next year)\n   * Works PT\n* Me (City Government): $68k\n   * Includes 457 Deferred Comp plan (which I max and can contribute to in addition to 401k)\n   * Includes State Pension valued at roughly $16k in contributions/year\n* Me (Solo Law Practice on Side): $75k\n   * $30,000 W2 Employee Salary\n   * $45,000 Distribution\n\n**Monthly Cash Flow**\n\n* Income: $13,333\n* Retirement Contributions: $5,125\n* Monthly Expenses: $6,000\n* *Plenty Left Over to Pay for Student Loan Payment*\n\n**Possible Retirement Buckets**\n\n* My 2021 Roth IRA ($6,000)\n* Wife 2021 Roth IRA ($6,000)\n* My 2022 Roth IRA ($6,000)\n* Wife 2021 Roth IRA ($6,000)\n* My Solo 401k for 2021: $27,000\n   * Contributed to 457 at government but none at solo practice yet\n   * Amount includes $19,500 EE match and $7,500 ER match\n* My Solo 401k for 2022: $28,000\n   * Amount includes $20,500 EE match and $7,500 ER match\n\n**Issue**: Basically I find myself paralyzed by choice. I've been working to pay off my student loans my entire professional career, but I don't think I ever could have imagined in 2014 that you could refinance these loans for 2.50%. \n\n**Options**\n\n1. *Pay Off Loans*. I can pay off the student loans and just be done with them, but parting with this much cash feels off with interest rates so low. \n2. *Invest Maximum*. I can do a hybrid where I pay off down to $50k, refinance the rest, and invest in tax-advantaged accounts. \n3. *Hybrid*. I can invest as much as possible, refinance at these ridiculously low rates, and pay them off over 5-10 years.\n4. *What About I Bonds?* I can also theoretically do $30k of I-Bonds for 2021, 2022, and 2023, for a total of $90k, and come out ahead of my student loan refinance rate. Is the hassle worth it?\n\nAny thoughts?",

        "selftext": "First off, this is a theoretical question and a temperature check of what this community thinks about the future: not the future of the stock market, but our species\u2019 future socio-economic progress/collapse. \n\nA fundamental reason why Bogle\u2019s investment principles works, is that in our current, global capitalist economic system, growth = profit. For example, when a company reaches a certain market cap, it\u2019s purpose is not to create great products, it\u2019s purpose is to grow ROI to shareholders by creating more products that will sell (sometimes better products, sometimes worse). It makes complete sense to invest long term in the biggest basket of stocks you can, because growth *will* happen. \n\nHowever, an economic system slavishly devoted to growth inevitably has its problems (to put it mildly).  A prescient 1974 MIT study modeled the possibility of societal collapse due to the limits of growth, and last year,[KPMG released an update to it.](https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2021/limits-to-growth.html)\n\nThis study is by no means definitive, nor contains empirical predictions, but it presents hypothetical, possible scenarios \u2014 each of which see industrial output stabilizing or crashing this century (I chose this study as it\u2019s an interesting conversation-starter, but there\u2019s a plethora of studies on the subject). \n\nFor those older demographics in this community, having this in mind doesn\u2019t change much. But for the younger ones, it\u2019s an interesting possibility to consider. \n\nThoughts?\n\nTL;DR: There\u2019s a possibility that the economic system which allows Boglehead investing to work, growth capitalism as we know it, might crash in our younger members\u2019 lifetime.

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI've been following Motley Fool on and off since 2000.\n\nI've been doing relatively well in the market over the years, but I made a major mistake at the March 2020 Covid crash.  I sold nearly everything early in the crash because I also thought everything was overvalued, and I thought this was the big one.  It did save me from the depths of the plunge, but then I missed the recovery.  I kept expecting it to plunge back down, as I couldn't understand how all these losses would not kill the market, and it didn't.\n\nAnyway, long story short, by November 2020 I realized I had made a big mistake.  I joined StockAdvisor on Motley Fool at the time as well as Seeking Alpha and resolved to put a lot of effort and time into stock picking and buying and holding.\n\nAfter a few months though, I got sick of Motley fool continuously pushing insanely overpriced stocks, with the standard answer that valuation doesn't really matter for good companies.  That makes no sense to me.  So let's assume the price of TSLA's stock tomorrow jumped up to $10K.  Would it still not matter?  How about $100k?\n\nI did get a few good winners through Stock Advisor like CrowdStrike and Broadcom and Lam Research, but also quite a few duds like Lemonade.\n\nI stopped buying any of their stocks about 6 months in but always wondered if they're right.\n\nSo I've done this experiment.  Not sure if anyone will find it interesting, but might be helpful if anyone is curious\n\nStock Advisor recommends two stocks a month.\n\nIt will also release two lists of 5 Best Buys now during the month.  One for team Tom, and the other team David (teams renamed now but can't be bothered to check what they're called)\n\nSo I've created two Test Portfolios.\n\n1. StockAdvisor Recommendations:\n\nIn this one, I simulated putting $5000 in every stock recommended by StockAdvisor, at the closing price of the stock for the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) StockAdvisor Best Buys.\n\nIn this one simulated putting $1000 in each one of the best buys announced on the day it's announced.\n\nI've captured all recommendations from Nov 2020 till Nov 2021 when my subscription ran out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Results**\n\n1. Stock Advisor Recommendations Portfolio.\n\nAs of today, it is down 10.95%.\n\nIt holds 21 different stocks.\n\nThis is what it looks like for the year compared to S&amp;P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efgspyitbx681.png?width=2652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb1b6d78f3fd781928209da298df476adc16e5db\n\n2) Stock Advisor Best Buys Portfolio\n\nAs of today, it is down 12.91%\n\nIt holds 53 different stocks\n\nThis is what it looks like for the year compared to S&amp;P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ynjz1xf5cx681.png?width=2651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=052da69c1e69ea3a282f6d1ac03388120ae21cab\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI think this is a horrendous performance honestly.  I know the Fools will say, we're here for the long game etc, and in the short term the market will fluctuate, but I think this was pretty predictable given how overvalued and overhyped nearly all their recommendations are.\n\nYes they do come across some massive multi-baggers, but if you buy all they recommend equally, I don't think you'll beat market.  The numbers they share are since they started around 2000 , which is not a valid scenario for any of us.\n\nNeedless to say, I've become a boglehead. Sold a lot of my individual holdings and moved into index ETFs with a set allocation which I will rebalance twice yearly.\n\nKept a few of the big bets I had which I still believe in, but let's see how they do.\n\nHope this was interesting to someone \n\n**Edit**\nI take on board all comments that 1 year is an unfair period of time.  Also my conclusion above may be overly harsh based on that.  I\u2019m going to continue monitoring these two portfolios for years to see how they do.  Will post the updates here every year.  I think it\u2019s a valid test as SA recommend you hold more than 15 of their stocks and both portfolios hold much more.",

        "selftext": "A lot of folks start by 'mirroring' allocations across accounts (e.g. holding 70/30 stocks bonds in taxable, *and* in their IRA *and* in their 401(k)), which can be OK ... *but* it can be simpler, cheaper, and more tax-efficient to **treat everything as one big portfolio**. There are a few good links in the sidebar about tax-efficient fund placement and a total-portfolio approach, but here are some concrete examples, including (A) a rather conventional scenario, (B) a case with limited 401k options, and (C) a complex asset allocation conundrum.\n\n--------------\n\n**Investor A** is a **baseline case**, someone who has good investment options across all accounts \n\n* Target allocation: 70/30 stocks/bonds, 50/50 US/international within stocks (so: 35/35/30 US/intl/bonds).\n* Space available: 60% 401k, 20% Roth IRA, and 20% Taxable. \n\nFirst, hold a balance of things in the 401(k) so you can rebalance tax-free (some each of US/intl/bonds in the 401(k)). At the same time, high-growth things go well in a Roth, so fill that space up with stocks if possible. In the current rate environment, Series I/EE bonds, Treasuries, and TIPS are all OK in taxable (relatively efficient).\n\n**Solution A: diversify in the 401k and put risk assets in the Roth IRA**\n\n* 401(k): 25% US, 25% intl, 10% bonds\n* Roth IRA: 10% US, 10% intl\n* Taxable: 20% bonds\n\nThere isn't one single solution to this problem, but starting with either (1) high-risk in Roth, and/or (2) high diversification in the Traditional/401(k) both help frame what else goes where. (Note: historically, you'd want to do things a little differently, prioritizing bonds in the Traditional/401(k) account, but this is less key these days). Also note the framing: it's less a matter of percentages within an account than percentages on the whole.\n\n---------------------\n\n**Investor B** has similar goals, but **limited good 401k choices**: only one cheap (500 index) \n\n* Target allocation: 70/30 stocks/bonds, 50/50 US/international within stocks (so: 35/35/30 US/intl/bonds).\n* Space available: 30% 401k, 30% Roth IRA, and 40% Taxable. \n\nWork backward from available options. In this case: fill up the 401k with that US stock fund, since that's the only good choice; then buy mid/small to complete the US side in the Roth IRA, then fill the rest of the Roth with international (Roths grow tax-free forever, so high-growth options are preferable there), then put whatever's left in taxable.\n\n**Solution B: prioritize less expensive fund options and diversify in other accounts.**\n\n* 401(k): 30% US\n* Roth IRA: 5% US small/mid, 25% intl\n* Taxable: 10% intl, 30% bonds\n\nPretty straightforward in this case, but rebalancing may still be difficult. An alternative option would be to put a bit of bonds in the Roth IRA so you can rebalance there. That, or: rebalance with dividends and new money.\n\n--------------\n\n**Investor C** is in the same situation as investor (B), but with **diversification limitations due to 401k space** -- so they not only have just one cheap (500 index) fund, but the 401k is also their biggest account\n\n* Target allocation: 70/30 stocks/bonds, 50/50 US/international within stocks (so: 35/35/30 US/intl/bonds).\n* Space available: 50% 401k, 10% Roth IRA, and 40% Taxable. \n\nThis is where things get tricky. They could still fill up their 401(k) with US, but it would tilt them farther than they want. There's no one-size-fits-all solution here, so it's going to come down to the expense ratio over other options in the 401(k). So still start with the 401(k) to at least the 35% mark, then determine priorities based on costs. And keep in mind that a 401(k) isn't forever -- when you change employers, you can roll that account into a Traditional IRA and pick the funds you really want. A few ways you could handle things in the meantime:\n\nFor investor C, if the other options are just absurdly expensive, a 'for now' solution could look like this:\n\n**Solution C1: tilt for now, fix it later**\n\n* 401(k): 50% US\n* Roth IRA: 10% intl\n* Taxable: 10% intl, 30% bonds\n\nIf there's, say, a not-too-crazy bond fund option (e.g. 0.4% ER), or even a money market, this could work too:\n\n**Solution C2: accept slightly higher expenses for now, fix it later**\n\n* 401(k): 35% US, 15% bonds\n* Roth IRA: 10% intl\n* Taxable: 25% intl, 15% bonds\n\nPersonally, I would lean toward C2 because it will be more on track with the plan plus easier to rebalance within the 401k. Either way, examples like this one are clearly the trickiest, and every situation is different, but if you keep in mind the key points below you can make the best of your situation. Cheers!\n\n-------------------\n\n**Why not just have the same allocation in all accounts?** For one thing, while it looks simple, it can get confusing and be hard to rebalance. There is also tax drag from this approach. It's not world-ending if it's your best or only option, but it's suboptimal. Regardless, every situation is different, but here are some **key takeaways**\n\n* 1) **Keep expenses low** as much as possible, but weigh options if your 401(k) choices are limited\n* 2) **Prioritize diversification in a 401(k)** or other tax-advantaged account for tax-free rebalancing\n* 3) **Prioritize risk assets in the Roth IRA** since that growth will never be taxed\n* 4) **Treat everything as one big portfolio** -- this can help save you on taxes and expenses\n* 5) **Write down your plan** so if new money shows up you know where it fits into the grand scheme of things.\n\nP.S. I wrote out a lot of example numbers here and would bet money I got at least one wrong, so if you see an error, please feel free to point it out. If you can think of other typical situations I should help explain, LMK.",

To understand why, we must ask ourselves why we are comparing with US in the first place.\n\nUS makes the majority of the world market cap, but this wasn't always the case. This means that during the process of becoming the country with the largest market cap, it must have had extraordinary stock returns, by definition. In other words, you are selecting the best performing country and comparing it with others, which is known as selection bias.\n\nIn 1990, you wouldn't be looking at US vs. ex-US. You would instead be looking at Japan vs. ex-Japan, and if you decided that you don't need ex-Japan exposure based on the past returns, you would have had very bleak returns coming forward.\n\nI'm not saying you cannot under any circumstances compare US to ex-US, however you must do it in a period where US didn't make up the majority of the market cap. A fair comparison would be in years 1950-1990. Unsurprisingly, the returns were very similar in this period.\n\nAnd as always, stay the course, stay diversified, don't stress about stocks too much, enjoy life.",

However, **we mods prohibit direct questions regarding taxes and other questions of legality because nobody here is a licensed tax professional in every single tax jurisdiction on Earth.**\n\nObviously no one is licensed in every jurisdiction on Earth (an impossibly high bar), but for the vast majority of posters who are based in the US, dividend taxation represents a huge factor (and in taxable: a massive, long-term cost drag) in terms of overall returns. It is vital that investors be able to discuss current and proposed federal tax legislation, and be allowed to help fellow investors understand state-specific tax consequences as well.\n\n&gt; The question of taxes varies so wildly between regions that even making basic generalizations borders on pointless. The only constant is that you will pay taxes at some point in your life on your investments. Whether it is before you make your gains, after you make your gains, or somewhere in between, you will pay taxes.\n\nAgain, generalized dismissals are unhelpful for communities within or beyond the US. Furthermore, the ability to defer or reduce taxes is one of the biggest advantages we have as investors. The variety between regions doesn't make generalizations 'pointless' at all -- these variations are critical factors in determining how to invest. And tax drag absolutely matters -- if it didn't, there would be little point to tax-deferred investing strategies. The ability to strategically control the timing and amount of taxes one pays on investment gains can easily make six-figure differences over a lifetime. This idea that 'taxes will be paid either way' is a dramatic oversimplification.\n\n&gt; The different types of accounts and options available to you varies based on your income, geography, employer, and dozens of other factors. variations on the tax question are so all over the place that I could break Reddit's character limit just covering the most general details.\n\nThis is simply and demonstrably untrue. Most posters on reddit have a similar set of options, including: taxable, Traditional and Roth accounts. See links on the sidebar for common and straightfoward answers to taxation questions. There are plenty of helpful wiki pages and other resources covering these basics --- tax-efficient investing allows ordinary investors to vastly improve their long-term gains. I really can't imagine how something so critical to even the most basic (dividend or other) portfolio strategy could be outright prohibited. And when there *is* person-to-person variation, that just makes it *all the more* important that tax questions be allowed.\n\nPlease don't brigade the dividend sub (or any other sub for that matter). I'm posting this not as a mod but as a user who is legitimately dumbfounded by the idea that such a critical issue could be banned from discussion altogether. I hope any subscribers to that sub will feel free to ask questions here. For those of you interested in dividend-centric strategies: consider taxation first and foremost, because tax drag can be a huge hindrance to your returns. And in the end, it's total returns that matter (after taxes and fees), whether those come from growth or dividends.\n\nIf you're confused or curious about dividends, [Ben Felix has a solid video on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ).",

That being said, I want to have a light hearted discussion on dividends, after yesterdays post saying dividends are meaningless. I watched the video, and I feel I grasp the core concept he was teaching, but still find myself disagreeing, even as an indexer. \n\nI want to throw my hat in the ring and say, \u201cno, dividends aren\u2019t meaningless, they have a place\u201d. \n\nI want to start out by mentioning where I am in agreement. I believe the following are absolutely true:\n\n-\tChasing dividend yield is meaningless.\n-\tOnly buying a company (or paying a premium for a company) because they pay a dividend is meaningless\n-\tin many cases a business may be better served by not paying a dividend and reinvesting that capital back into the core business so that it can grow.\n-\tYes, dividends are a tax drag on a portfolio. Totally true. The video demonstrated this point super well.\n\n\nNow, hear my humble case for why dividends DO matter:\n\n-\tDividends provide people in retirement or close to retirement a mechanism to live off of income that has better tax treatment than ordinary income (qualified dividends)\n-\tDividends provide investors a mechanism to get a return on capital without selling shares or chipping away at their portfolio\u2019s principle. This is especially important in retirement, where you don\u2019t want to drain your fund any time you need money.\n-\tDividends can act as a stabilizing mechanism in down markets. Reliable companies will still pay their dividend even in a down market (dividend aristocrats), especially if nothing has changed about the underlying core business. This isn\u2019t always the case, but is *often the case*.\n-\t\u201cdividends decrease the stock price by the amount the dividend is paid\u201d. I don\u2019t think this is true. Mathematically plausible, sure. But the stock market is emotional. In the short term, meaning days or weeks, this will be true, you can expect share price to decrease by dividend payout. Because the ex dividend date payout is priced in. But the market is fickle, and more often than not those companies prices will jump right back to their price before, and continue to grow afterward. In this sense you get a return on capital in the form of a dividend, and get to leave your stock alone and let capital appreciation continue to do its thing over years to come without needing to sell shares.\n-\tThe point above is even more true when you look at companies with a high prospect of growth like Apple or Microsoft who aren\u2019t dividend aristocrats. Their share price doesn\u2019t correlate at all to their dividend payout. You just can\u2019t count on a stocks price to go up or down relative to its dividend. \n\n\nI consider myself a Boglehead first and foremost, I wouldn\u2019t call myself a dividend investor, or dividend growth investor or anything like that. But I absolutely love receiving my quarterly Vanguard dividends, reinvest them as soon as I can, and plan on using dividends as a form of income down the road when I\u2019m closer to retirement or in retirement. I believe the dividend snowball is an absolutely real thing. \n\nDividends do matter. But chasing yield, and ONLY investing in a company for its dividend is a recipe for disaster. \n\nSo continue indexing, and gather those index\u2019s dividend each quarter and watch that passive income grow. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.\n\nEDIT: That being said, I\u2019m still willing to hear why I might be wrong. I\u2019m still in my investing learning journey.",

If you don&amp;#39;t, it will surely master you\n- Complex investments exist only to profit those who create and sell them\n- Avoid fiscally irresponsible people and don&amp;#39;t marry one\n- Spend less than you earn, invest the difference and avoid debt\n- Money can buy many things, but nothing more valuable than your freedom\n- Being independently wealthy is every bit as much about limiting needs as it is about how much money you have.\n  - It has nothing to do with how much you earn\n    - High income people go broke\n    - Low-income people gain financial independence\n  - Money can buy many things, none of which is more important than your financial independence\n- Avoid investment advisors\n  - Sound investing isn&amp;#39;t complicated\n- Try to save 50% of your income\n- Save a portion of every dollar you earn\n- If you intend to achieve financial freedom, you are going to have to think differently. It starts with recognizing that debt should not be considered normal\n- No one can predict when drops in the market will happen\n- Financial independence is about having options (Fuck You Money!!)\n- Avoid debt at all costs\n- Those who live paycheck to paycheck are slaves\n- Many people never learn HOW to think about money. It isn&amp;#39;t about buying stuff\n  - Remember the lost &amp;quot;Opportunity Costs&amp;quot; of things we buy\n- You can&amp;#39;t time the market, so don&amp;#39;t even try\n  - If you could time the market, you would be better than Warren Buffett\n- Market crashes are to be expected\n  - Toughen up, learn to ignore the noise and ride out the storms\n- Why most people lose money in the market\n  - They think they can time it \u2013 they can&amp;#39;t\n    - The majority of investors get worse returns than the funds they pick. Why? Bad timing.\n  - They believe they can pick individual stocks \u2013 they can&amp;#39;t\n  - They believe they can pick the right mutual fund managers \u2013 they can&amp;#39;t\n    - 82+% of funds fail to outperform the index\n  - They watch CNBC and worry about the day-to-day instead of worrying about long term\n- Never buy stocks on margin\n- Governments love a little inflation. They can add a little money to the system, keep the economy going and not have to raise taxes or cut spending to do it. That is why it is called the &amp;quot;Hidden Tax&amp;quot; because it erodes the buying power of our currency. It also allows debts (like governments) to pay back their creditors with &amp;quot;cheaper dollars&amp;quot;\n- Stocks are a good inflation hedge in the long term\n- There is no risk-free investment. Even cash under your mattress has inflation risk\n- 2 stages in life \u2013 not necessarily tied to your age\n  - Wealth Accumulation \u2013 working, saving and adding money to investments.\n  - Wealth Preservation \u2013 earned income slows or stops. Your investments are now left to grow and/or provide income for you\n- Simple is good, Simple is easier, Simple is more profitable\n- Be a long-term investor\n- Asset Allocation Rule of Thumb\n  - 100 \u2013 age in stocks\n  - 120 \u2013 age in stocks if you want to be more aggressive\n- 3 funds needed to build a portfolio\n  - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTSAX)\n  - Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (VBTLX)\n  - Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index (VTIAX)\\*\n  - Cash or Money Market Fund (Emergency Fund)\n    - Stocks are the wealth builder and inflation hedge; bonds are the deflation hedge and you have cash for emergencies\n    - Low cost, simple, and effective\n    - \\* (If Desired) He doesn&amp;#39;t personally see the need for international funds but doesn&amp;#39;t strongly oppose owning them either\n  - The other fund option is a Vanguard (or equivalent fund family) Target Date Fund (TDF). They are likely to be found in 401k options. They are an excellent choice.\n- Indexing is good because the odds of selecting stocks that outperform (although not impossible) are vanishingly small, better results will be achieved by buying the stocks in the index\n- Many people still don&amp;#39;t like to index\u2026 why?\n  - It is difficult for smart people to accept that they can&amp;#39;t outperform the index\n  - It means you are accepting the market &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; return\n  - The financial media is full of stores of people who outperformed the index for a few years.\n    - Over periods of 15-30 years though, 82-99% of the indexes will win\n  - People underestimate the fees they pay to managers\n  - People want exciting, quick results and bragging rights. Buying an index and holding long term isn&amp;#39;t exciting. Get your excitement someplace else\n  - There is a huge business selling advise and doing trades to people who can be persuaded to believe they can outperform\n- Indexing is easier, simpler and more effective at building wealth than alternatives\n- Bonds are our deflation hedge; stocks are our inflation hedge.\n  - Bonds also tend to be less volatile than stocks and smooth out the road\n- Difference between stocks and bonds\n  - Stocks \u2013 you are buying ownership in the company\n  - Bonds \u2013 you are loaning money to the company or government\n- Deflation is when the price of stuff falls, when the money you have lent is paid back, it has more purchasing power. Bonds are good here\n- Inflation is when the price of goods rises and so money owed to you loses value. Here it is better to own assets like stocks that rise in value with inflation\n- When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. When interest rates fall bond prices rise\n- Inflation is the biggest risk to your bonds\n- The irony of investing is that the more you watch and fiddle with your holdings the less well you are likely to do\n- During the accumulation phase, celebrate market drops. While you are in the wealth accumulation phase, these are gifts. Each dollar you invest will buy more shares.\n  - But remember, you can&amp;#39;t time these drops so don&amp;#39;t try\n- During the accumulation phase he recommends putting all your money into a Vanguard Total Stock Market Funds.\n  - You can add a total bond fund (if desired) but then you will need to rebalance.\n- When you are in the wealth preservation phase, you will need to add bonds to the fund\n- You can fine tune the asset allocation (stock and bonds) as desired to your specific needs\n- You will want to rebalance about one time a year and if the AA gets more than 20% out of line\n- If you don&amp;#39;t want to mess with rebalancing the funds, a target date fund (TDF) is an excellent choice\n  - But try to hold in a tax advantaged account if possible\n- Factors that can affect your AA decisions\n  - Temperament \u2013 your personal ability to handle risk\n  - Flexibility \u2013 How willing and able are you to adjust. Spending? Location? Work? Lifestyle?\n- When you are about 5-10 years from retirement, you should start slowing shifting your AA toward bonds\n- Vanguard is owned by its shareholders and he recommends using their funds if possible.\n- Anyone using a High Deductible Health Plan should put money into an HSA\n- Don&amp;#39;t use a financial advisor. But if you want to, get an advisor paid by the hour.\n- I can&amp;#39;t pick winning stocks, you can&amp;#39;t pick winning stocks, but don&amp;#39;t feel bad, because most experts can&amp;#39;t either. Index and be happy. Buffett and Graham both recommend indexing.\n- If you come into a lump sum of money. The math says to put it into the market right then. The market is up yearly roughly 75% of the time and down 25%. But if from a psychological point of view, you want to Dollar Cost Average, that is ok too. But understand the math is against you.\n- You reach financial independence when you have 25X your annual expenses.\n- The general safe withdraw rate is 4% a year. The range of safe withdraw rates is between 3-7%. But this depends on many different factors.\n- Plan your financial future assuming that Social Security will not be there, and if it is, then enjoy",

        "selftext": "I consider myself a fairly competent and sharp person, but when it comes to investment decisions, my track record is abhorrent. I passed on Bitcoin pre-2015, and Ethereum pre-2018. I sold NVIDIA when I was 14 years old (2007 custodial account), I barely broke even during the 2020 crash, and my taxable account captured basically none of the 2021 bull run. I am thankful that my 401k doesn't (easily) allow me to mess things up on my own accord.\n\nI want to say one more thing - since 2019 I have read into a lot of strategies and tools - DCF and Buffett/Graham-style stock picking, sentiment analysis, technical analysis, order flow, I learned about macro trends and factors, bond markets, futures, options, it never really seems to end.\n\nNone of that really helped me much at all. None of it seemed to give me any real edge. I think most of that knowledge is absolutely useless for anyone that works 9-5, and simply doesn't have the bandwidth to ruminate over their equity positions day after day. My largest gain last year - by a giant, giant margin - were stupid options purchases around the time of the GME squeeze (BB, NOK, NAKD). Absolutely bone-headed decisions.\n\n*It pays a whole lot more to be lucky than smart, and you're probably not very lucky, or smarter than the hawks watching the markets every day.*\n\n**So here's what I do now:**\n\nI set up an M1 account with recurring deposits that align with my situation, income, and risk tolerance. I don't necessarily think you need to stick with M1, or Vanguard funds, but that is what works for me.\n\n-\t30% VOO (S&amp;P500)\n-\t20% VXF (ex-S&amp;P US fund)\n-\t20% VEA (ex-US developed markets)\n-\t10% VWO (ex-US emerging markets)\n-\t8% VIOV (small cap value)\n-\t5% BND (US bonds)\n-\t5% BNDX (ex-US bonds)\n-\t2% VBR (small-mid cap value, higher AUM)\n\nI like this setup because it fits with a lot of lazy portfolios, but allows me to have some control over geographic distribution and large/mid/small cap allocation. VT, or VTI/VXUS would probably work out just fine too.\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps at least one person who is on the fence about moving from active to passive investing. It has helped my stress level and focus tremendously too. Life's too short to worry about the next CPI numbers or whatever.\n\nStay lazy!\n\nEDIT: This is such a great community. Thank you all for your feedback. I'm switching to a 60/30/10 split for VTI/VEA/VWO. Much simpler, and I don't need bonds right now. See you all in a few decades! :p",

        "selftext": "# Winning the Loser&amp;#39;s Game by Charles Ellis\n\n- Investment managers are not beating the market, the market is beating them\n  - Over 1 year, 70% of professionals underperform their benchmarks\n  - Over 10 years, 80%\n  - Over 15 years, 90%\n- Yes, some professional money managers will beat the market in any given year. But most will not over the long term and there is no reliable way to figure out who would be in that 10% that outperforms ahead of time\n  - Individuals investing on their own do even worse and individuals who day trade do the worst of all on average\n- In the 1960&amp;#39;s, when active investing was a winner&amp;#39;s game, individuals did 90% of the trading and institutions did 10%.\n  - Professionals could beat the amateurs easily.\n- Professional money managers now do 95% of the trading on wall street now.\n  - They are so good as a group that they make it nearly impossible for any one of them to outperform the market. They don&amp;#39;t make enough errors for their peers to exploit.\n- Although figuring out the optimal investment policy can be difficult, the hardest part of investing is staying committed to a sound investment policy\n  - Being rational in an emotional environment is not easy\n    - Develop your plan and stick with it\n- Active investing is, at the margin, always a negative sum game\n- Just because a manger had success in the past, does not mean he will have success in the future\n- To be a long-term winner, set realistic goals and develop sensible investment polies that will achieve those objectives and then have the discipline and fortitude require to implement those policy&amp;#39;s\n- The only way active investment managers can beat the market, after adjusting for market risk, is to discover and exploit other active investors mistakes and overcome the high costs of fees\n- Active investors have 3 ways of doing this\n  - Timing\n  - Selecting specific stocks or groups of stocks\n  - Making timely changes in overall portfolio structure or strategy\n    - Market timing is a truly wicked idea, don&amp;#39;t try it\n    - The only way to beat the market is to beat the professionals who, as a group, are the market. The problem isn&amp;#39;t the research isn&amp;#39;t done well. It is that the research is done well by so many\n- Although the market isn&amp;#39;t perfectly efficient, its not longer worth the real costs of trying to beat it. If you can&amp;#39;t beat them, join them and buy index funds.\n  - Stock markets are different than they were 60 years ago (1960&amp;#39;s)\n  - Indexing outperforms active investing\n  - Index investing is low cost\n- The daily weather is comparably different than the climate. Weather is about the short run. Climate is about the long run. This applies to finance too. Ignore the short term and focus on the long term.\n- Gravity is a powerful force. A powerful force in finance is regression to the mean. This is the tendency of a series of events to become more normal or average over time\n  - As Example \u2013 Very hot or very cold days tend to be followed by less hot or cold days\n  - The same &amp;quot;back toward normal&amp;quot; occurs with P/E multiples\n    - Stocks with very high or low P/E ratios tend to move back toward normal. Causing a double whammy!\n  - The power of regression to the mean is valuable. Don&amp;#39;t get caught up in the hype either positive or negative as an investor.\n- Investing is not supposed to be fun or exciting\n  - Stick to your plan as an investor and ignore the noise is the secret to long term success\n- Indexing has lower fees, lower taxes and lower operating expenses\n  - Using an index fund allows the investors to keep pace with the market virtually without effort\n- Warren Buffett recommends most investors consider indexing\n- Indexing advantage\n  - Less Taxes\n  - Less Fees\n  - Less Costs\n  - More peace of mind\n- Study after study shows index investing works\n- Index investing &amp;quot;unfair&amp;quot; advantages\n  - Higher rates of return\n  - Lower management fees and expenses\n  - Lower taxes\n  - Lower transaction costs\n  - Lower portfolio turnover\n  - Convenience\n- The case for indexing increases as the period lengthens\n- To minimize risk relative to return or to maximize return relative to risk, investors should consider at least diversifying internationally.\n  - 50/50 US/Foreign is a good starting point\n- Investors who decide to concentrate their investments in their home country are making an implicit decision to emphasize that one country over others. Curiously, most investors do just that. British investors favor UK, Canadian investors favor Canada, Japanese investors favor Japan, American investors prefer USA.\n- The more turnover in a portfolio, the more taxes and the lower accumulated returns\n- Investors essential truth &amp;quot;We have met the enemy and he is us.&amp;quot;\n- Behavioral Economics\n  - We fail to appreciate the power of regression to the mean\n  - We ignore the normal pattern of experience\n  - We believe in &amp;quot;hot hands&amp;quot;\n  - We overreact to first impressions and then anchor to those views\n  - We suffer from illusion of control\n  - We rely on expert opinions and are overconfident in those opinions\n  - We overestimate out own skill and knowledge\n  - We respond to the &amp;quot;halo effect&amp;quot; of a recommendation of someone we admire, like a celebrity or athlete\n  - We are overly impressed by short term results\n  - We are &amp;quot;confirmation biased&amp;quot; looking for and then overweighting the data that supports our conclusion\n  - We anchor too much to our initial opinion\n  - We confuse familiarity with knowledge and understanding\n  - We overreact to both good and bad news\n  - We think we know more relative to what others know than we really do\n- Investors risks to avoid\n  - Trying too hard and taking too much risk\n  - Not trying hard enough, usually by having too much cash or money market accounts\n  - Being Impatient\n  - Changing mutual funds too much (holding less than 10 years)\n  - Borrowing too much\n    - 3 out of 4 fortunes that are lost got lost because borrowed money was used\n  - Being naively optimistic\n  - Being proud\n    - We overestimate our own ability\n  - Being emotional\n    - We are happy when our stocks go up and sad when they go down. And the feelings are stronger the faster the change in prices\n- Given enough time, investments that might otherwise seem unattractive become highly desirable, and vice versa.\n- The longer the time period over which an investment is held, the closer the actual returns in a portfolio will come to the expected average\n- If a time period is abundantly long, a wise investor can commit without great anxiety to investments that in the short run would appear too risky\n- The single most important dimension of your investment policy is the asset mix. Specifically, your equity and fixed income. Analysis shows repeatedly that the tradeoff between risk and reward is driven by one key factor: time.\n- If the market has been going up, investors, who curiously usually evaluate future prospects by looking into rearview mirror, will assume some further upward momentum.\n- And if the market has been going down, investors will assume further downward momentum.\n  - The wise investor will adjust for this notorious human tendency\n- History of return on investments show 3 key points\n  - Common stocks have average returns that are higher than bonds. Bonds have higher returns than short term money market instruments\n  - The fluctuations of actual returns on common stocks exceed the fluctuations on bonds, which in turn exceed the fluctuations on short term instruments\n  - The magnitude of fluctuations in rate of return increases as the measurement period is shortened and decreases as it is lengthened.\n- This means rates of return appear more normal over longer periods of time\n- Develop an investment policy for yourself and then follow it\n- Too often investment policy is too vague and is left to be resolved in haste when distressing market conditions are present. This is when it is too easy to make the wrong decision at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.\n- The best shield against the disruption of the markets short term provocations is understanding and knowledge.\n- Put your investment policy in writing so you will follow it when times are bad\n- When the market drops, we stop buying and, in fact, usually start selling. And when the market rises, we buy more and more enthusiastically.\n- We are wrong when we feel good about stocks having gone up and we are wrong when we feel bad about stocks having gone down\n- A knowledge of yourself and history prevents panic during these times\n- Every investor can be a winner\n  - Ignore the &amp;quot;beat the market&amp;quot; hype\n- Each investor must decide what are investment policies that they can and will stay with through thick and thin over the long term\n- If your investment policy is not determined through carefully developed understanding, it will be determined by improvisation\n- The markets specialty of short-term focus is the mortal enemy of long-term investment success\n- Over very long periods, the average return obtained by most actively managed mutual funds must be expected to be close to the market average minus 1.5% for various costs\n- The average mutual fund investor actually gets a return that is significantly below the average return that they invest in\n- Why? Frequent trading in and out of funds and chasing performance instead of staying the course\n- Index investing advantages\n  - Anyone trying to beat the market faces an increasingly formidable challenge\n  - Operating costs are far lower than active investments\n  - Taxes are lower due to decreased turnover\n  - Fees are much lower\n  - Easier to stay on plan\n  - More time for other activities\n- Investment professionals daily trading volume by decade\n  - 10% in the 1960&amp;#39;s to over 90% currently.\n- This is why it is so difficult for active managers to beat the market\n- Understanding the outlook for the near term is easy as J.P Morgan said, &amp;quot;It will fluctuate.&amp;quot;\n- One way to be realistic about future returns is to assume that future range of P/E multiples and corporate profits will be within their historical upper and lower limits and will appear with frequency at values close to the long-term average\n- Investors almost always project recent past market and economic behavior out into the future, somehow expecting more of the same to continue\n  - Math example \u2013 If dividends are at 1.5% and corporate earnings are growing at 4.5% (Historical Average), then a composite of 6% return is reasonable. This is the fundamental rate of return the investor can expect from the market\n  - Then you add or subtract the changes in P/E over that time frame. The average P/E in recent decades has been about 15.5. This is the speculative return component\n- Predicting the market roughly is not hard, but predicting it accurately is impossible\n  - Predicting where the market will be in the long run is not hard, but even estimating how it will move in the next few months is impossible and pointless\n- Investing must always begin with savings. No savings means no investing\n- Having a defensive saving reserve is a must. Just like a fire extinguisher\n- 10 Commandments for individual investors\n  - Save\n  - If you must &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; in the market, do it will a small portion of your money\n  - Don&amp;#39;t do anything in investing primarily for tax reasons\n  - Don&amp;#39;t think of your home as an investment\n  - Don&amp;#39;t do commodities\n  - Don&amp;#39;t get confused by stockbrokers and salespeople\n  - Don&amp;#39;t invest in novel or unusual kinds of investments\n  - Don&amp;#39;t invest in bonds just because you heard they are safe. Bond prices fluctuate and are a very poor defense against the major risk of long-term investing: inflation.\n  - Write out your long-term goals and have an investment plan in place\n  - Distrust your feelings\n- Your responsibility is to decide on your long-term investment objective and determine a reasoned and realistic set of investment policies that can achieve your objectives\n- The individual investor does not have to beat the market to be successful\n- Warren Buffett &amp;quot;Investing is simple, but it&amp;#39;s not easy.&amp;quot;\n- The real challenge is to commit to the discipline of long-term investing and avoid reacting to the short-term distractions\n- Winning the loser&amp;#39;s game of beating the market is easy: DO NOT TRY IT!!\n- Index your investments\n- The real purpose of investment management is not to beat the market; it is to do what is right for each particular investor who accepts the responsibility of defining their true and realistic investment objectives, developing sensible long-term policies, and staying with them.",

        "selftext": "I absolutely loved The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins and amongst all the noise out there, I decided to follow this book almost to a tee. \n\nOne part of that approach was favouring lump sum investing vs. DCA. Collins makes a very sound argument for lump sum investing (based on empirical data) and it really resonated with me. Particularly because I sold my business back in late 2021 and had a lump sum to invest. I was one of the lucky ones to be in this position\u2026or so I thought.\n\nI researched, read hundreds of posts on investing forums, read several books (including the Millionaire Teacher), put together an amazing spreadsheet for tracking and eventually worked up the courage to invest basically all of it into VTI/VXUS as a lump sum when the market first started to really dip.\n\nThat was the first two weeks of January. Every rational part of my brain is saying to keep cool and remember the teachings in the books. The totally logical reasons for investing in the first place and that I have a 15-20 year horizon to help things revert to the mean. And yet, knowing all this \u2014 understanding it intimately \u2014 my emotions are running wild right now. I endured 2008 when I was just starting my career, I got through March 2020 without too much of a sweat\u2026But this time, I\u2019m dealing with an amount of money much larger than anything I\u2019ve ever invested before. \n\nLike everyone else, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball but it seems the writing might be on the wall for what\u2019s to come over the next while. By which point, I will likely be down well into the 6 figures. I won\u2019t ever sell, I\u2019d rather see it drop to 0 (I know, not really possible). But emotionally, I really thought I\u2019d be handling this better.\n\nI just can\u2019t believe I agonized over this every single day for almost 5 months and when I finally worked up the courage to follow the sound advice of experts, it seems I might have made the exact wrong decision. Maybe this year ends up being the 1/3 of the time that DCA is the better approach. Typical. And now in hindsight, it does seem kind of obvious with the run up we had in 2020/2021. *sigh*",

        "selftext": "# The Intelligent Asset Allocator by William Bernstein\n\n- In the long run of investing, you are compensated for taking risks\n  - Conversely, if you seek safety, your returns will be low\n- Experienced investors understand risk and reward are intertwined\n  - One of the easiest ways to spot investment fraud is the promise of excessive returns with low risk\n- One sign of a dangerously overbought market is a generalized underappreciation of the risks\n- Nonsystematic Risk \u2013 Risk that disappears with diversification\n- Systematic Risk \u2013 Risk that cannot be diversified away\n- Stock are to be held for the long term.\n- Individual investors are drawn into stocks during powerful bull markets\n  - They don&amp;#39;t appreciate the risks with stocks. And after they have suffered the inevitable loss, they sell.\n    - No investor ever avoids loses at times, no matter how skilled\n- REIT&amp;#39;s and Precious Metals stocks can have a place in a portfolio even if they have lower expected returns\n  - They are inflation hedges and likely to do well in an inflationary environment in which other stocks and bonds would be adversely affected\n- The best way to estimate future stock returns is the DDM (Dividend Discount Method)\n  - Return = Dividend Yield + Dividend Growth Rate + Multiple Change\n    - Dividend yield is the yield on the investment (Example \u2013 2020 S+P 500 yield is 1.5%). The Dividend growth rate is historically 5%. And the Multiple change refers to the increase or decrease in the overall P/E ratio.\n    - The Dividend yield and dividend growth rate is the fundamental return (easy to estimate). The Multiple change is the speculative return (impossible to estimate).\n      - Benjamin Graham \u2013 &amp;quot;In the short run the stock market is a voting machine (speculative return), but in the long run, it is a weighing machine (fundamental return).\n- Do not expect high returns without high risk. Do not expect safety without correspondingly low returns\n- The longer a risky asset is held, the less chance of a poor result\n- Those who are ignorant of investment history are bound to repeat its mistakes\n- Dividing your portfolio between assets with uncorrelated results increases returns while decreasing risks. Most important concept in portfolio theory\n  - Two assets with positive returns should not have persistent highly negative correlations.\n    - Mixing assets with uncorrelated returns reduces risk. You can find these.\n      - In the long run though, meaningful negative (inverse) correlations are never seen. That would be too good to be true if they did.\n- The optimal Asset Allocation of the last 20 years is unlikely to look anything like the one for the next 20 years.\n  - The optimal AA can only be known in retrospect\n- Rebalancing increases long term portfolio performance\n  - It instills the investor with the discipline to buy low and sell high\n- If two assets have similar long term returns and risks are not perfectly correlated, then investing in a fixed rebalanced mix of the two not only reduces risks, but also actually increases return\n  - The excess return though is not obtained without rebalancing. It forces you to buy low and sell high to rebalance your asset allocation\n- Sticking by your AA policy through thick and thin I much more important than picking a &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; AA\n- But in real life risks, returns, and correlations of various assets fluctuate considerably over time\n- Real assets are almost always imperfectly correlated (Mostly positive) in real life (An above average return in one is somewhat more likely to be associated with an above-average return in the other)\n  - It is difficult to find 2 assets that are uncorrelated and it is practically impossible to find 3\n- Correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1\n  - Uncorrelated is 0\n  - Inverse is -1\n  - Perfect is +1\n- In general, Bond durations of 6 months to 5 years are ideal for the risk dilution portion of the portfolio.\n- If you are unhappy with the degree of risk in the portfolio, you have 2 ways to reduce it\n  - Employ less risky individual assets (Not a good idea) \u2013 like adding large cap for small cap stocks, domestic for foreign stocks, utility for industrial stocks. It changes the dynamics of the portfolio\n  - Stick with your basic asset allocation and replace some of your entire stock AA with short term bonds. (Good idea)\n    - Risk Dilution \u2013 if you believe that you have arrived at an effective stock allocation, it is generally a better idea to employ risk dilution as this leaves the stock AA undisturbed\n      - A conservative risk adverse strategy will almost always involve at least a small amount of exposure to very risky individual assets\n- Recency bias \u2013 biggest mistake most experienced investors make\n  - We tend to extrapolate recent trends indefinitely into the future\n  - Try as hard as you can to identify the current financial wisdom so that you can ignore it\n    - In 2000, when the book was published, US was doing better than foreign stocks. What were the experts saying at that time?\n      - Stay at home for higher returns\n      - Buy only companies you know\n      - Diversify abroad at your own peril\n      - If you do diversify abroad, only do where you can drink the water\n- Beware of recency and do not be overly impressed with the asset class returns over periods of less than 2-3 decades.\n- Foreign stocks belong in everyone portfolio. The primary benefit is to reduce standard deviation or risks\n- Something everyone knows isn&amp;#39;t worth knowing\n  - Identify the era&amp;#39;s conventional wisdom and then ignore it\n- Next year&amp;#39;s efficient frontier portfolio (high return at low risk or decent returns with no risk) will be nowhere near last years.\n  - No one consistently times the market\n  - Some managers spend lots of money researching macroeconomic, political, and market analysis to try to guess which assets will perform best in the future. And this is a fool&amp;#39;s errand.\n    - Why? The market has already priced this information into the current price\n- Periodically rebalance your portfolio back to your policy allocation. This will increase your long-term return and enhance investment discipline\n- Effective portfolio diversification can increase return while reducing risks. Achieving this benefit requires rebalancing the portfolio back to its target or &amp;quot;policy&amp;quot; AA. This is difficult to do and almost always involves moving against the market sentiment\n- Long term success in individual security selection and market timing is difficult to impossible\n- The future cannot be predicted, so therefore it is nearly impossible to specify in advance what the best asset allocation will be. Our job is to find an AA that will do reasonably well under a wide range of circumstances\n- Sticking to your target AA through thick and thin is much more important than picking the right AA\n- An optimizer will heavily favor those assets with high historical or assumed returns. This is a problem because asset returns have a tendency to &amp;quot;mean revert&amp;quot;.\n  - If you can predict the inputs to the optimizer well enough, then you didn&amp;#39;t need an optimizer to begin with.\n  - Don&amp;#39;t use an optimizer to try to develop an asset allocation. We can&amp;#39;t predict returns, standard deviations, or correlations accurately enough. And if we could, we wouldn&amp;#39;t need one anyway.\n    - And optimizing historic returns is a one-way ticket to the poor house\n- A well-diversified portfolio is not a free lunch. It does not come anywhere near eliminating risk. You will still suffer loss from time to time\n- Diversification not only reduces risks, but also gives a &amp;quot;rebalancing bonus&amp;quot; or extra return from rigorous rebalancing.\n  - The benefit is also psychological because you are getting into the habit of buying low and selling high. Thus, profiting by moving in the opposite direction of the market\n  - A distrust of &amp;quot;expert opinion&amp;quot; is one of the investors most useful tools\n  - It also limits your exposure to only one market segment\n- AA The Three-Step Approach\n  - How many different asset classes do I want to own?\n  - How &amp;quot;conventional&amp;quot; of a portfolio do I want?\n  - How much risk can I and do I want to take?\n    - How much complexity can you tolerate and tracking error?\n    - The law of diminishing returns applies to asset classes. You get a diversification boost from the first several, after that, you are just amusing yourself\n- Examples of various AA based on complexity\n- Level 1 AA\n  - Large Cap US\n  - Large Cap Foreign Stocks\n  - Short Term US Bonds\n    - Level 1B\n      - Small Cap US\n- Level 2 AA\n  - Large Cap US\n  - Foreign Large Cap\n  - Small Cap US\n  - Small Cap Foreign\n  - Emerging Market\n  - REITs\n  - Short Term US Bonds\n    - Level 2B\n      - Precious metal equity\n      - International Bonds\n- Level 3 AA\n  - Everything in level 2 but tilt toward value stocks\n    - Level 3B\n      - Precious Metals Stocks, Natural Resources, Utilities\n      - Specific nations equity or bonds\n- The more complex your AA, the more tracking error you will get vs the index (Like the S+P 500). You have to ask yourself how much will that bother you?\n  - Tracking error means that your portfolio will behave very differently than everyone else&amp;#39;s\n  - If that bothers you, then you need a simpler portfolio. If it doesn&amp;#39;t, then you can be more complex.\n    - Increasing the number of asset classes will improve diversification but will also increase your work and tracking error\n- It is impossible to forecast future optional portfolios by any technique\n- Your precise AA will depend on three factors\n  - Tolerance to tracking error\n  - Number of assets you wish to own\n  - Tolerance for risk\n- Two types of investors, those who don&amp;#39;t know where the market is headed, and those who don&amp;#39;t know that they don&amp;#39;t know\n  - For all practical purposes there is no such thing as stock picking skill\n    - Those early high returns attract large number of investors who wind up with average returns (if they are lucky)\n- Mutual fund manager performance does not persist and the return on stock picking is zero\n  - These managers ARE the market, so there is no way they can ALL perform above the mean\n- 4 Layers of Mutual Fund Costs\n  - Expense Ratio\n  - Commissions\n  - Bid-Ask Spreads\n  - Market-Impact Costs\n- Charles Ellis (an avid tennis player) first saw the data demonstrating a lack of money manger skill. And He thought, I have seen this before in tennis matches.\n  - Most amateur tennis matches winning or losing was less a matter of skill and more of matter of playing conservatively and avoiding mistakes\n  - This applies to investors, those who simply buy and hold a diversified stock portfolio usually come out on top (Indexing).\n    - Success in both tennis and investing is less a matter of winning and more a matter of avoiding losing.\n      - The easiest way to lose is to trade excessively.\n      - The ultimate loss avoidance strategy is to simply buy and hold the entire market or to index\n        - This reduces all the expenses associated with active management\n- Dunn&amp;#39;s Law \u2013 When an asset class does relatively well, an index fund in that class does even better\n- The only money made from newsletters is from the subscriptions, not from taking the advice\n- Do not rebalance too frequently. Let momentum work for you.\n  - This means to rebalance at most once per year\n- Money mangers do not exhibit consistent stock picking skill\n- Nobody can time the market\n  - Because of the above 2 points, it is futile to select money mangers on the basis of past performance\n    - Because of the above 3 points, the most rational way to invest in stocks is to use low cost passively managed index funds\n- Stocks outperform almost all other assets in the long run because you are buying a piece of our almost constantly growing economy\n  - But then investors make the mistake of thinking the most profitable stocks to own must be those of the most rapidly growing companies (Growth Stocks)\n- Long term returns are usually higher when valuations are cheap and lower when they are expensive\n- Paul Miller did the first study on cheap stocks called the Dow P/E strategy. He examined buying the 10 lowest P/E stocks in the Dow from 1936-1964 and discovered that the lowest P/E stocks (those everyone hates) actually outperformed the market and the highest P/E stocks (those everyone loves) greatly underperformed\n- Dreman has observed that &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; stocks tend to fall less in price than &amp;quot;growth&amp;quot; stocks when earnings disappoint. Conversely, &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; stocks tend to rise more in price than &amp;quot;growth&amp;quot; stocks when earnings exceed expectations.\n  - To put it another way, good companies are generally bad stocks, and bad companies are generally good stocks\n- It has puzzled academics EMH theorists why these value type strategies have worked so well for so long even after they were discovered. (The market should have arbitrated this away long ago). The reason the strategies still work is that cheap companies are dogs, and most people cannot bring themselves to buy them. This concept is very difficult for investors and money managers alike.\n- The best explanation for value stocks can be found in Robert Haugen The New Finance: The Case Against Efficient Markets. In 1993 the highest 20% P/E stocks (Growth) had an average P/E of 42. Earnings yield was 2.36% or 1/42. The lowest 20% P/E stocks (Value) had a P/E of 12. Earnings yield was 8.38% or 1/12. So, if you bought growth stocks in 1993, you received $2.36 for every $100 invested. If you bought value stocks then, you received $8.38 in earnings for every $100 invested. That means growth stocks earnings have to grow 3x larger than value stocks just to break even. The growth stocks did have higher earnings than value, but not enough to catch up.\n- Both the behavioral (people don&amp;#39;t like buying bad companies) and increased risk (companies are not in great financial shape) explain value companies higher returns than growth.\n- Value companies tend to do better than growth during bear markets\n- Dividend Discount Method (DDM) formulated by John Burr Williams in 1938 was formulated by a simple idea. Since all companies eventually go bankrupt, the value of a stock, bond or the entire market is simply the value of all its future dividends discounted to the present.\n  - And since a dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today, its value must be reduced or discounted to reflect the fact you won&amp;#39;t receive it today.\n    - The reduction is called the Discount Rate (DR)\n      - The DR is determined by the cost of money (Risk Free Rate) plus the risk to the lender\n        - Safer investments have a lower DR and risker investments a higher DR\n      - DR can also be thought of as the expected return of the asset\n        - Lower risks = lower DR = Lower expected return/Higher Present Value\n        - Higher risks = higher DR = Higher expected return/Lower Present Value\n      - Formula \u2013 Reasonable Price = (Annual Dividend Amount)/(DR \u2013 Dividend Growth Rate)\n        - But you can make this formula say anything you want depending on your inputs. So be careful with this formula\n- Dynamic asset allocation refers to the possibility of varying your policy allocation because of changing market conditions.\n  - Only people who have mastered fixed asset allocation and the required rebalancing should consider dynamic asset allocation.\n  - He used to recommend changing your equity/bond AA based on conditions but that doesn&amp;#39;t work anymore. Now he only recommends changing equity allocations\n- When stocks get more expensive, their future returns are likely to be lower and when stocks are very cheap, future returns are likely to be higher.\n  - Based on this, it is not a terrible idea to change your AA slightly in the opposite direction based on valuations, but not by much.\n    - When you rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target AA, you purchase more of an asset that has declined in price, and thus cheaper.\n      - When you actually increase the target portfolio weighting of an asset when its price declines and gets cheaper, you are simply rebalancing in a more vigorous form \u2013 you are &amp;quot;overbalancing&amp;quot;\n    - Do not change your AA based on changes in economic, political conditions or analyst recommendations, that is a poor idea\n      - In the authors opinion, overbalancing is likely to increase return if done correctly. But few investors have the nerve and discipline to rebalance and &amp;quot;overbalancing&amp;quot; requires even more of that nerve and discipline so few should try it.\n- The average investor suffers from overconfidence and thinks that they can beat the market, but this is a mathematical impossibility.\n  - The average investor must by definition obtain the market return minus expenses.\n- Investors suffer from recency bias.\n  - When prices fall, investors estimate of future returns goes lower too. This is irrational.\n  - Investors tend to overweight more recent data and underweight older data\n    - Most investors are &amp;quot;convex&amp;quot; traders in which they buy equities as they are rising and sell as they are falling.\n    - The opposite is a &amp;quot;concave&amp;quot; investor who buys as prices fall and sells as they rise\n      - In a world dominated by convex traders, it is an advantage to be a concave trader, and vice versa.\n- Human beings experience risk in the short term. This is because in nature, our ancestors had to focus on short term risks to survive.\n  - Unfortunately, this is of less value in a modern society, specifically in the world of investing.\n- Vanguard and DFA are great choices for funds. Vanguard is owned by the shareholders.\n- ETFs\n  - Advantages \u2013 Can be traded throughout the day, do not generate capital gains taxes\n  - Disadvantages \u2013 Incur commissions and spreads\n- Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) vs Lump Sum investing \u2013 from a purely financial point of view, it is usually better to put your money to work right away. However, if you are not used to owning risk assets, then it might be best to go slow and DCA your way into the market\n  - DCA \u2013 Involves investing the same amount regularly in a given fund\n  - Do not underestimate the discipline that is sometimes necessary to carry out a successful DCA program.\n- Value Averaging (VA) \u2013 Is another technique for investing in the market (read the book for more information on how to do it)\n- Rebalancing in your tax advantaged accounts every year or two should be ok\n- Try not to rebalance in your taxable accounts or do it as little as possible. Try to rebalance though buying because rebalancing triggers taxable events\n\nSummary\n\n  - Risk and reward and inextricably entwined\n    - Do not expect high returns from safe assets\n  - Those who do not learn from history and condemned to repeat it\n    - Become familiar with the long-term history of the behavior of different classes of stocks and bonds\n  - Portfolios behave differently than their constituent parts\n    - A safe portfolio does not necessarily exclude very risky assets. Even the investor who seeks the safest possible portfolio will own some risky assets\n  - For a given degree of risk, there is a portfolio that will deliver the most return\n    - But this can only be known in retrospect\n    - The investor&amp;#39;s objective then is not to find the efficient frontier, rather the goal is to find a portfolio mix that will come reasonably close to the mark under a broad range of circumstances\n  - Focus on the behavior of your whole portfolio, not its parts. Some will be doing very well or very bad at times\n  - Recognize the benefits of rebalancing\n  - The markets are smarter than you are\n    - Very few money mangers beat the market over the long term\n    - Do not run with the crowd\n  - Keep an eye on market valuations\n    - Changes in your policy AA should be made only in response to valuations changes, and in a direction opposite the market\n  - Good companies are usually bad stocks; bad companies are usually good stocks\n    - Favor a &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; approach to investing\n  - In the long run, it is very hard to beat a low-cost index fund",

        "title": "Lessons from Buffet: Never Lose Money",
        "selftext": "Hey friends and fellow investors,\n\nI am an avid reader and one of the best investing ideas I have recently learned about is the difference between arithmetic and geometric returns and how that leads to wealth creation. Thought I would share my learnings with you guys for your feedback and thoughts.\n\n*----*\n\n*\u201cThe first rule of investing is never lose money\u201d \u2013 Warren Buffet*\n\nInterest in investing seems to be at an all-time high right now. People of all ages and wealth statuses are looking to invest in numerous asset classes across both public and private markets.\n\nThis is wonderful. More people interested in investing should hopefully result in more people achieving financial security.\n\nTo achieve that goal, investors need to leverage the most powerful force available to them, compounding. However, most people focus on arithmetic returns when making investment decisions, which puts the goal at risk. Analyzing investments based on arithmetic returns creates a higher chance of losing money. What successful investors do is evaluate investment opportunities through the lens of geometric returns.\n\nThat is exactly what we will dive into in this essay: What are geometric and arithmetic returns? Why does focusing on geometric returns lead to better decision-making? How can you use this concept to make smarter bets?\n\n# Having The Right Perspective\n\nWhen evaluating investments, we can adopt either an arithmetic or a geometric view. The perspective we choose will determine which opportunities we pursue.\n\nAn arithmetic return is the average we are all familiar with. It is the sum of a series of returns, divided by the total amount of series. This is the simple average most people are familiar with and the most common way to evaluate opportunities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7gsvepu8tve81.png?width=231&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84afd8c255d513809f88d5bc73782cb5df0f5fcf\n\nGeometric averages are calculated differently. Multiply all the returns (plus 1) and raise it to the inverse of the length of the series.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6awoms9tve81.png?width=415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bb87b08f116e80c99ab1889eef8166446c8069f\n\nUnderstanding the formulas is not important. What is essential is to remember that we should examine investment returns through a geometric lens ***because doing so accounts for compounding.***\n\nWhy am I placing such emphasis on compounding?\n\nInvesting is a process that happens sequentially through time. It does not occur in just one interval of time, or the aggregate of many intervals of time. This means that returns are an iterative process; returns compound. In each period ***we invest what we are left with*** from the last period. Thus, the starting size of our capital base will determine how large our compound interest will be.\n\nThis is the principle that fundamentally determines the nature of investing and the way we need to interpret returns. Looking at geometric returns is how we capture this principle in metrics.\n\nAs critical as this concept is, the difference between these two metrics is not intuitive. To make it more tangible, let\u2019s look at a gambling example.\n\n# Playing Dice\n\nImagine you are at a casino table with a big stack of cash in front of you\u2014your entire life savings of $100. You are going to play a game of dice.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n* If you roll a 1, you lose 50% of your entire savings\n* If you roll a 2, 3, 4, or 5, you make 5% of your entire savings\n* If you roll a 6, you make 50% of your entire savings\n* You can play as many times as you want\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mocg6ratve81.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=769c1b3f42708cd610933568972499346f18292f\n\nWould you play?\n\nThe proposition sounds like a symmetrical bet with an obvious edge from the extra 5% you should get 2/3rds of the time. The expected arithmetic return is 3.3%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ceapiihbtve81.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43f899127fbca7805111fabc9174f271c3a85dba\n\nNow, you might have some hesitation if you were allowed to play the game once and you rolled a 1. Playing once exposes you to being unlucky and having your wealth cut in half. Playing numerous times should remove luck from the equation and result in an average expected return of 3.3%. So, you decide to play.\n\nWhat would your outcome be?\n\nUsing a Monte Carlo simulation, the table below shows your chances of ending up in different wealth buckets assuming you play the game 300 times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2366khactve81.png?width=255&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=007490f7de964b876fd3ad972602d81cb085b681\n\nPlaying this game results in a \\~50% chance of ending up with less than $1 and a \\~80% chance of having less than your initial $100. Yet, the arithmetic expected return is 3.3%.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nThe culprit is how arithmetic averages are calculated.\n\nThe simulation resulted in many outcomes with low ending wealth values but a few outcomes with incredibly high ending wealth values. The high but unlikely outcomes are ***so good that they lift up the arithmetic average***.\n\nHere\u2019s another way of thinking about this: If Bill Gates walks into a bar with nine people, on average there will be 10 billionaires at the bar.\n\nThis should highlight the difference between the ***most likely outcome*** and the ***average outcome***. As investors, we should focus on the most likely outcome to avoid the arithmetic trap. This is where geometric returns come in.\n\nWhen we consider the geometric average, it is clear that this is a bad bet. We lose -1.5% of our wealth per roll. Compounded over 300 rolls, we are essentially left with nothing.\n\n# Math Or Magic?\n\nBased on the above, we might assume that never playing this game is the right answer.\n\nHowever, that isn\u2019t quite true. When you focus on increasing geometric returns, magical things start to happen.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the same game but add one additional rule: You can choose to bet as much of your wealth as you want.\n\nBased on this new rule, you now bet 40% of your capital base on each roll instead of going all-in. You keep the remaining 60% on the sideline earning nothing.\n\nBy betting less of your wealth, your arithmetic average falls predictably by 60%\u2014from 3.3% to 1.3%. But before you get disappointed, remember that geometric average is what really counts. When we park money on the sideline, our geometric average increases to 2.1%.\n\nWhen you play 300 times, you end up making money in \\~82% of the outcomes, with an expected ending wealth of \\~$700, an increase of \\~7x your starting wealth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fokexhfdtve81.png?width=347&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d4e603c9677f1e4410b8552b4afb81386556c96\n\nPause there for a second and let that simmer.\n\nWe lowered our risk profile by parking 60% of our net worth out of the bet ***and*** increased our return.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that go violate the risk &amp; return tradeoff\u2014a core pillar of traditional finance? How did we get a higher geometric return by betting less? Is this math or magic?\n\nThe answer involves the relationship between two competing forces: (1) the edge of a specific investment or bet and (2) a concept called Negative Geometric Drag (NGD). \\[1\\]\n\nThe edge of an investment or bet is the mathematical advantage you have. Sticking to the example above, our edge is the 3.3% arithmetic advantage.\n\nNGD is the drag on your return caused by gaining and then losing the same proportion of your wealth. It is based on the principle that ***a loss*** ***disproportionally*** ***hurts you*** because it reduces your capital base for the next investment opportunity. For example, if you have $100 and you lose 50%, your ending wealth is $50. To grow your wealth back to $100, you need more than a 50% return; you need a 100% return since your starting wealth is now $50.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e1k3e16etve81.png?width=466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aad75be4c9280df2bf7d78e4a1c365574ff2b207\n\nYou can think of the relationship between the edge and the NGD as a seesaw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kedx0hzetve81.png?width=418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a71a4505a04e9840957ee400cd9819fd205887b\n\nWhen you bet a lower percentage of your total wealth, the edge is the more powerful force and the NGD is negligible. However, as the portion of the investment size as a percentage of your total wealth increases, the NGD becomes the more powerful force and the impact of a loss hurts you more than the edge. \\[2\\] This is because the edge of an investment grows linearly to the amount invested but, NGD grows exponentially. \\[3\\]\n\n# Protect Your Capital\n\nIn all the situations described above, we had certainty over probabilities and outcomes. The real world is not as precise. But there are still useful principles and heuristics we can extract.\n\nThe most important is to focus on geometric returns and compounding.\n\nRemember, when we invest, the capital base we start with is the ending capital base from the last period. The capital base is the very thing returns are built on. This means a large loss disproportionately lowers our geometric return because it leaves us with a much lower capital base to reinvest and compound on our next wager.\n\nMore tactically, this means taking steps to preserve your capital base. \\[4\\] This doesn\u2019t mean avoiding risky bets; rather it requires you to understand how to size your position in risky bets, so your edge is greater than the NGD.\n\nWith that, I will leave you with Buffet\u2019s second rule of investing: \u201c*Never forget rule number 1.*\u201d\n\nRegards,\n\nArash Param\n\n*Notes, Inspirations &amp; Additional Readings*\n\n* \\[1\\] Nick Yoder explores this concept in more detail in his article \u201cThe Kelly Criterion\u201d.\n* \\[2\\] If you want to look at the mathematical logic driving this concept, I have linked a Google sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wDt48gdAYRUUt_cMDkFaa7NAnbX3yUKZXSLlftGyQrs/edit?usp=sharing).\n* \\[3\\] The optimal ratio between the NGD and the edge is called the Kelly Criterion, but we won\u2019t dive into that today.\n* \\[4\\] Having this perspective should also fundamentally change how you perceive certain risk management products such as insurance, sitting on cash, or other safe haven assets. You can think of insurance as a drag on your arithmetic return but a boost in your geometric return. When the boost in geometric return is larger than the drag in arithmetic return, it is a good trade. More importantly, insurance can be positive sum, with both the insurer and the insured winning. For more on this, I recommend that you read *Safe Haven* by Mark Spitznagel.",

He was super well spoken, gave convincing examples (like how Google didn't rebrand itself Waymo just cause) and was super persuasive about the bear case. If I didn't know about this sub, I'd have thrown my money into FB puts by the end of that clip.\n\nThen I listened to [Kevin O'Leary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6LLj1DYHos&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision) go on about how Meta has missed earnings goals only thrice in the last decade and about how high the standards are for the company because of its dominance in the market. He also spoke passionately about how often he uses FB marketing for his small businesses and how ubiquitous Meta is in so many indexes. The man's arguments seemed beyond reproach and just as convincing as Brown from earlier. If I hadn't watched the previous video, I'd be into FB calls by now, thanking my lucky stars about the dip.\n\nBut before I'd do that, this clip of [Jim Cramer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_cEwQkilCE&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision) catches my eye. The man says the markets are going bipolar and nothing is predictable right now so the best thing to do is take cash out of the market and wait it out. He's super driven with his sleeves rolled up, no coat and looks like the well-meaning neighbor I've been living next to for decades. Surely he can't be wrong?\n\nAnd this is just for FB. We have similar talking points for AMZN, SNAP, NFLX and many many others. Everyone sounds right, everyone seems genuine, everyone is passionate and convinced they're right. But everyone can't be right, so who's the right one? \n\nAs I was going through these videos, I found myself imagining how I'd be investing if not for this sub. I'd be in and out of every stock that I'd hear about on a given day, confused and disoriented from the onslaught of opinions everywhere.

Combined, they fall short of VT's 9,364 holdings. However, if you look at the total list of holdings for each fund and how much weight each company represents in the index, the top 300 or so companies make up the lion's share of value. In VT, once you get past 2,333 companies, each of the rest represent less than 0.01% of the fund. Let me repeat, I like VT and think it is good. But I also see VT held up as the gold standard for diversification to the point that anything other than VT is regarded as inefficient. Remember that the introduction of the S&amp;P 500 index fund in 1976 was regarded as socialist, anti-American investing for representing so many companies' value at once and removing so much homework from investing. VTSAX brought what could be considered \"true\" total market investing in 1992, followed by VTWAX for global investing in 2019.\n\nTo make an intra-company comparison, FZROX's size and style makeup mirrors that of FSKAX, just as FZILX does for FTIHX. Is FZILX missing small cap international? Yes. Could each Zero fund stand to hold more companies? Sure. Would those companies tilt the indexes' performance so much? Not to a significant enough degree to rule them out, imo. Are the Zero funds as diverse as possible? No, but that doesn't mean they're not pretty gosh-darn diverse to the point of reflecting total market value already. And if the companies they leave out are for the reasons outlined in the indexing methodology (liquidity, market cap, trading volume), then there's at least a rhyme and reason to it.\n\n# The Zero Funds Are Loss Leaders: TRUE\n\nThey attract investors with the 0% expense ratio in the hopes of selling other financial products like advisory services, ATM/credit cards, and market funds outside the Zero group. Also, as far as I'm aware, ~~the Zero funds are not offered in any 401k/403b/457b plans, so there's still plenty of money to be made offering more expensive funds to corporate retirement plans.~~ (thanks for keeping me honest, u/Big_Dick_Balla! Some retirement plans DO offer the Zero funds, nice.)\n\nIn addition, \u201cLending securities to earn income for the fund\u201d appears in each prospectus. Fidelity's making money off the shares owned by the indexes.\n\n# Fidelity Keeps The Dividends For Themselves: FALSE\n\nThe dividends are reinvested throughout the year, with an annual distribution to the investor. The claim \u201cFidelity is taking your dividends!\u201d pops up every so often with certainty, when that is not the case. Would quarterly dividends perhaps be more useful for certain withdrawal strategies in retirement? Sure. But Fidelity's not robbing investors by using an annual distribution schedule.\n\n# You Can't Transfer The Zero Funds To Another Brokerage: TRUE\n\nYup!\n\nAny other claims that you see pop up from time to time?\n\n# FZILX Doesn't Include Emerging Markets: False\n\nFZILX contains 25.55% emerging markets, as compared to 24.70% in VXUS and 28.25% in FTIHX. (thanks u/Cruian!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Full disclosure**: I think holding Zero funds in tax-advantaged accounts and VTI+VXUS in taxable is the most efficient way to go. Holding mutual funds in a taxable account will generate greater taxable events than ETFs. This doesn't necessarily bust a myth, but tax-efficient allocating is important to one's investing strategy, and several comments reflect that.",

The first three days this week he was up a couple hundred dollars on random trades, today his account tanked to 300$.\n\nBefore he started this and when I declined he wanted to understand why I didn't \"understand\" the stock market. I do understand it, I just know after researching, that 99% of retail day traders will lose money.  I told him there is a second thing that could happen other than going to 10k and that was going to 0.

        "selftext": "Nope. Not even then.\n\nOne of the foundational principles of Boglehead investing is to never try and time the market. There is plenty of evidence to back this up. People with billions of dollars seem to try and do it and they seem to do no better than your average Joe sticking their money into a total market fund. \n\nDCA is a decent strategy in order to overcome nervousness for new investors putting a lot of money into the market. But you should know that lump sum investing is generally the smarter play. Yes even in whatever situation you think we might be at any particular moment in time that makes now different.\n\nI see posts every day asking if you should time the market. They may be long term bogleheads or today might be their first time learning about any of this stuff and this post if for everyone. \n\nThe market will always be doing weird things. Now is not any more special than a year ago or a decade ago. So to the person who is about to make a post asking if they should time the market the answer is no. Should you DCA? Perhaps, if it will help you feel better about investing your large amount of money. That is a perfectly acceptable strategy especially if the alternative is to not invest any money. But the reason is more about emotions and more times than not, you will come out behind than if you had lump summed.\n\nIf you disagree with, this that is fine. Feel free to start a discussion about how you debunked this. Boglehead investing might also not be for you and that is also fine. If you are really insistent that you have the secret sauce and can time the market I congratulate you. You can probably sell this secret for such a large amount of money that you won't even need to invest and can retire tomorrow. \n\nBut if you are expecting people to answer your question about timing the market with anything other than no, I think you will be disappointed.\n\nFor more info about Boglehead philosophy please read this and other pages on the wiki: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy",

But they do protect against inflation in the long term\n    - To put it another way stocks, protect against deep risk, but exacerbate shallow risk\n  - Widespread diversification of stocks protects against inflation because it is unlikely that all nations would have massive hyperinflation at once\n  - Inflation devastates bondholders. Especially when it is a surprise/unexpected.\n - Fixed rate mortgage payments are also good for inflation\n  - A value tilt also provides protection against inflation. This worked in both domestic and international\n  - Inflation is the most likely of the scenarios to play out. But is the easiest to protect against.\n    - International diversification\n    - Value Tilt\n    - PME\n    - Natural Resource Stocks\n    - Retired people should use TIPS\n\nSkating Where the Puck Was\n\n-\tWhen credit contracts during a crisis, investors reevaluate their risk tolerance, seek the comfort of government secured vehicles, and dump all their risky assets - ALL OF THEM\n-\tShort term crashes can be painful, but long-term returns are far more important to wealth creation and destruction\n-\tResign yourself that diversifying among risky assets provides scant shelter from bad days or bad years, but that it does help protect against bad decades and generations. Which can be far more destructive to wealth\n\nRational Expectations\n\n-\tStocks that have the potential to have high returns during crises, especially inflationary ones, should consequently have the lowest returns of all among equity classes (Like PME)\n-\tWilliam Bernstein believes in 3 different industry groups for consideration into a portfolio\n  1. REITs\n  2. Precious Metal Equity (PME)\n  3. Oil/Natural Resource Equity (NR)\n-\tOil and Natural Resource stocks are a great inflation hedge and under appropriate circumstances, might not be unreasonable to have additional allocation to commodities producers\n-\tDon&amp;#39;t purchase commodity futures. They are great in theory but not in practice. There used to be &amp;quot;Backwardation&amp;quot; in the futures market when investors were scared on deflation in their products and needed downside protection (IE a farmer selling his wheat crop in 9 months). Now inflation is the primary concern and futures contracts are in a condition known as &amp;quot;contango&amp;quot; which drives up the costs and reduces future returns\n\n4 Pillars\n\n-\tPM funds have low expected return. But they are almost perfectly uncorrelated with the market and during global market meltdown, they are likely to do well. PM are also a hedge against inflation. But be careful with PM. Because you will be going against the market and you need to rebalance during. You will be selling when everyone on TV is saying to BUY and you will be buying when everything is good and people will tell you how dumb that is.\n\nThe only guide to alternative investments\n\n-\tREIT&amp;#39;s are a great choice. But do not invest in mortgage REIT&amp;#39;s as they are bonds and not equity\n-\tREIT&amp;#39;s have a low correlation to both stocks and bonds. This is true of domestic and international\n-\tInternational REIT&amp;#39;s can provide a benefit but their expenses tend to be higher so be careful. A 50/50 domestic and international REIT AA is a good starting place\n-\tDo not treat your personal home as a financial asset. It is a place to live. It should not be included in your overall AA plan\n-\tInvestors who are not real estate professionals should gain exposure to REIT&amp;#39;s though low-cost mutual funds and not directly buy properties as a way to achieve broad diversification\n-\tREIT&amp;#39;s provide a reasonably good long-term hedge against inflation\n-\t5-15% is a good AA for REIT&amp;#39;s in your portfolio\n-\tTIPS provide a guaranteed rate of return and are less volatile than nominal return bonds\n-\tTIPS have a lower correlation to equities than nominal return bonds\n-\tCommodities (Hard Assets) have negative correlation to stocks and bonds and act as a hedge against event risk (wars, disruptions, political instability, etc.) and inflation. Usually made up of Energy, Industrial Metals, PM, Ag, Livestock\n-\tCCF&amp;#39;s do will during times of rising or unexpected inflation. But do poorly during times low or falling inflation\n-\tLarry Swedroe likes Collateralized commodity futures (CCF) and not the actual producers\n-\tWilliam Bernstein likes commodities, but not CCF&amp;#39;s. He likes the actual commodity producers(Example - Oil and Materials).

Especially good for retired persons who need a hedge against inflation\n-\tThere is a large rebalancing bonus (as much as 5%)\n-\tPME are HIGHLY volatile so be careful and rebalance\n-\tPME tend to experience long periods of very low returns during periods of economic and political stability and short periods of high returns in times of crisis\n\nGlobal investing\n\n-\tThere is a weak negative correlation between inflation rates and stock returns\n-\tThe short-term relation between equity returns and inflation is weak, but over the long term equity returns impound inflation rates\n  - In 1920&amp;#39;s Germany Hyperinflation, stocks hedged inflation well, but investors would have been better off if inflation didn&amp;#39;t take place\n-\tThe negative relation between stocks and inflation is a short to intermediate term phenomenon. Over the longer terms, stocks behave as claims to real economics assets\n-\tInflation is likely to remain a factor in society, primarily because governments spend more than they receive in taxes, forcing the governments to borrow. Monetization of this debt causes inflation.\n-\tOver the long term, real estate should provide returns competitive with those on stocks and bonds, and its low correlation with other assets makes it valuable for diversification. Real estate has also been a superior inflation hedge\n-\tCommodities futures have low correlations with other assets.\n  - Commodities and bonds tend to act opposite each other\n    - Why? Commodity futures are claims to real assets, while bonds are claims to money payments\n-\tGold was more volatile than commodity futures but had a better return.\n-\tCommodity futures tracked inflation fairly well, but underperformed it\n\nThe delusions of crowds\n\n-\tMarket Bubbles require 4 necessary conditions\n  - Technological and financial displacement\n  - Credit loosening\n  - Amnesia of the past\n  - Abandonment of time-honored valuation principles\n-\tUnder most circumstances, the Federal Reserve cares about 2 things\n  - Overall state of the economy (as measured by GDP growth and unemployment)\n  - Keeping inflation under control\n    - Stock prices are of lesser concern and often wind up a bystander of the other 2 policies\n-\tThe Fed primary operates via the federal funds rate (interest rate at which member banks lend to each other overnight)\n  - When interest rates on these are high, they attract investors. Which pulls investment from risk assets (stocks) and lowers their prices. The opposite is true\n\nAsset Allocation\n\n-\tNo liquid investment alternative with stable guaranteed principal exist that can provide real returns by consistently beating the combined impact of inflation and taxes\n-\tGovernments are the primary beneficiaries of inflation, in part because of tax structures that tax nominal rather than real incomes\n-\tCommon stocks do much better in a low inflation environment. They have performed poorly during deflation or high inflation, especially if the inflation is unexpected.\n  - Over the longer run, the companies can make adjustments to inflation, but in the short run those adjustments are difficult to accomplish\n\nA Random Walk Down Wall Street\n\n-\tExercise 6 \u2013 Buy a house. Real estate is a great inflation hedge. REIT&amp;#39;s are a good choice to own commercial real estate\n-\tExercise 8 \u2013 Gold can have a place in your portfolio (5%). It is a good diversifier and is an excellent inflation hedge. Don&amp;#39;t invest in diamonds or Collectibles. Buy diamonds and collectibles because you like them. Not as an investment. Do NOT invest in commodities futures contracts. You will get burned. Stay away from hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital funds. They are great for the managers, not for you\n\nStocks For the Long Run\n\n-\tUnder a paper money standard, bad economic times are more likely to be associated with inflation, not deflation like the 1930&amp;#39;s. Under these circumstances, stock and bond prices tend to be more correlated. Thereby reducing the diversifying qualities of government bonds\n-\tBecause of this it is unlikely that bonds will remain a good long-term diversifier, especially if inflation looms once again\n\n-\tBonds are bad during inflation as they are fixed income investments whose cash flows are not adjusted for inflation.\n  - It is also bad for the stock market. Stocks have proved to be poor hedges against inflation in the short run. But are great in the long run\n-\tAlthough fascinating to observe and understand a market&amp;#39;s reaction, investing on the basis of data releases (CPI, unemployment, etc.) is a tricky game and best left to speculators. Most investors will do well to watch from the sidelines and stick to a long-term investment strategy.\n\n-\tInflation and Deflation have characterized history as far back as economists have gathered data. But since 1955, there has never been a single year in which the US consumer price index declined\n-\tWhy the shift, because instead of Gold having control, now the government does and they always provide liquidity to prevent prices from declining\n-\tThe market used to react more to fed policy. But investors have become so geared to watching and anticipating Fed policy that the effect of its tightening or easing is already in the market.\n-\tStocks have an inflation hedge or an ability to maintain its purchasing power during periods of inflation\n-\tSince stocks are claims on the earnings of real assets, assets whose value is intrinsically related to the price of the goods and services they produce, one should expect that their long-term returns will not be harmed by inflation\n-\tStock are not good hedges against inflation in the short term, but no financial asset is. In the long run however, stocks are very good hedges against inflation, while bonds are not\n-\tSmith&amp;#39;s Common Stocks and Long-Term Investments showed that stocks outperform bonds in times of falling and well as rising prices.\n-\tFisher found that in theory, stocks will be an ideal inflation hedge\n-\tIf inflation rears its head again, investors will do much better in stocks than bonds\n\nSafe Havens\n\n-\tGold\n    - Hedge against the banking system.\n    - No counter party risk.\n    - Historically thought of as a hedge against inflation. But, is a very noisy hedge against inflation.\n      - It is mostly tied to movements in real interest rates (When inflation goes up faster than nominal interest rates, real rates go down, pushing up gold prices).\n    - Mildly explosive crash (market down 15%) payoff on average (30% in the 1970&amp;#39;s and 7% since) but, it has had a very wide range of returns since the 1970&amp;#39;s.\n    - Gold is all about investors&amp;#39; expectations of value, it has no yield and has no intrinsic value.\n      - It is for that reason impossible to fundamentally value.

        "selftext": "I'm glad to say that my 12 year old son has been asking questions about investing recently, including how compound interest works, the best way to invest, etc. He now wants to invest his monthly allowance ($50), or at least a portion of it, in long-term investments. I promised him I'd figure out the best way to go about investing in a broad index fund and that I'd set it up for him.\n\nSo, my question: what is the cheapest/cost-effective way to go about investing in VTI or similar on a monthly basis in small, equal amounts? He'd be looking to continue investing $30-50/month for the foreseeable future and increasing that amount as he gets older.\n\nA separate, but related question, would it make sense to invest in a mix of US and global equities, perhaps at an 80/20 split or something along those lines for a kid his age?\n\nAppreciate any concrete suggestions and advice.

        "title": "Lifecycle of a Boglehead",
        "selftext": "# Part 1: The Virgin\n\nI started out like like many of you. I had some extra cash from my college job. I stumbled upon some random Youtube video talking about savings accounts and mortgages and such. They mentioned S&amp;P 500 index funds and 8% returns and I thought, \"Hey that's great!\" And so I put my money into an S&amp;P 500 mutual fund. I was pretty happy. But then the demonic thought struck me, \"If my money is going to be invested, shouldn't I try to put it into the investment that will make me as much money as possible?\"\n\n# Part 2: Performance Chasing\n\nShortly thereafter I discovered QQQ. There was one article showing how QQQ had returned over 700% since 2010 while the S&amp;P 500 returned just over 200% and the Dow was even worse. \"700% is so much better than 200%! I'm going to invest in QQQ!\" I even put money into TQQQ. Oh those were such innocent times.\n\n# Part 3: The Stock Picker\n\nIn order to reaffirm my beliefs that QQQ was the best fund out there, I read many articles talking about growth. These often compared growth to value, and mentioned that value historically has beaten growth. \"More outperformance?\" I thought. \"Sign me up!\" I read about Buffett and finding cheap but great companies. I wanted to be like him. So I googled the best value stocks. Micron came up all over the place. It was at $85 and falling. I thought, \"It was so much higher before, this looks really cheap now!\" All the analysts were saying Micron was a great stock with 20% upside, 40% upside, 60% upside. There was no way I could go wrong! Two days in a row it went up 3-5%. \"The momentum is going back up! Now is the time to buy!\" I sold half of my QQQ and put it into Micron. I was so happy with my research. Almost like clockwork it immediately fell the next week. I kept holding on. I read every article from seeking alpha and everywhere else about Micron. Over and over I reaffirmed my beliefs that it was coming back up. It didn't. After a couple months I sold for a $500 loss.\n\nThe stress of huge intraday swings, watching the market every day, reading every article on my portfolio, and being constantly in the red was awful. I hated it. \"I'm done with individual stocks. I'm sticking to index funds from now on.\" In hindsight, I'm glad I only lost $500 learning this lesson.\n\n# Part 4: Birth of a Boglehead\n\nI still wanted the best returns possible on my investment, so I continued pursuing factor investing. I eventually stumbled upon Ben Felix's Youtube channel on factors, and then just kept watching everything else he made. I listened to Rational Reminder every week and discovered the Boglehead community from random searches on factor investing. I learned about diversification, international investing, factors, bonds, taxes, account types, staying the course, low fees, and everything else I could. This info not only helped me craft a portfolio that fit my needs but helped me understand so much better how that portfolio will behave and not to be surprised. Just keep buying. These lessons have made my emotional burden with investing so much lighter.\n\n# Part 5: Bogle Transcendence\n\nDuring this period I discovered Optimized Portfolio and, because investing research had become my hobby a long time prior, I obviously read every article on the site. Amazing work there. Without that site I would never have learned about long term treasuries being the best diversifier to stocks or about (\\*suspenseful pause\\*) leverage. \\*bogle screams in his grave\\*. I started investing in hfea and ntsx. I read all of the major reddit and original forum posts about hfea and leverage. Hopefully it will give me financial freedom much earlier in life than I could achieve otherwise.\n\n# Part 6: Moving On\n\nI spent a lot of time on r/bogleheads and r/letfs. Eventually, everything become redundant. Almost every post was about the same things. There wasn't a lot of new stuff to learn or do. Trading strategies do get pretty advanced, but I've got no interest. My goal was to make more money, not less lmao. But that's the goal, isn't it? To get your knowledge and strategy down to a point that you can forget about it.\n\nNowadays I spend much less time on investing. I only know what's going on in r/bogleheads from r/boglememes lol. Now I just need to find a new hobby.",

        "selftext": "If an analyst makes 50 stock recommendations that outperform the market, does that mean his subsequent recommendations are likely to beat the market as well? Likewise, if some analyst makes 50 bad recommendations, does that indicate that his future stock picks will be bad?\n\nThat is the question I want to answer.\n\nUsing historical analyst recommendations data from Yahoo finance - Thanks Nobjos! - I compared analysts' earliest recommendations versus their subsequent recommendations. My reasoning is that if past successes can predict future returns, then the performance of analysts earliest recommendations should correlate with performance of subsequent recommendations.\n\nA central question is how long of a track record is sufficient to gain insight in future performance. As a start, let\u2019s try 50 stock recommendations. Below I\u2019ve plotted the 4-month performance of analysts\u2019 first 50 stock recommendations (x-axis), and compared it to the performance of all of the analysts\u2019 recommendations since then (y-axis).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h18dk0w9lrj81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef78b9ae16d04fafff6fd15876857904565c525c\n\nThe exact correlation is -0.083, which is very low. This means that the first 50 stocks have no (or even a slightly inverse) correlation with subsequent performance. Basically, if an analyst did well early, it does not mean they will do well in subsequent predictions. **A good example to illustrate this is Wolfe research: their first 50 recommendations performed on average 2.8 (absolute) percent over the S&amp;P 500. However, their subsequent 81 recommendations underperformed by a whopping 5.4%.**\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering about the outlier on the left. That's BofA (deez nuts). No seriously, BofA Securities, Inc., previously Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML), who's f**irst 50 recommendations underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a disturbing 9.5%**. If you had seen their track record back then, you probably never would\u2019ve listened to them again right? Well, **their subsequent 242 stock recommendations averaged an amazing 3.3% over the S&amp;P 500.**\n\nBut you might think \u201c*Well if 50 stocks isn\u2019t enough of a track record to predict future returns, what about 100?*\u201d Here\u2019s how that looks:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hmbguydqkrj81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a34306568d82ea8bc385e1d5d2be695c5fe731ef\n\nAgain, it\u2019s a complete mess with no discernible correlation. This time, the exact correlation is -0.062. *A lot of large firms had a negative track record up till this point, including Morgan Stanley, UBS, Citigroup, Guggenheim and Deutsche Bank. Yet all of these would go on to outperform the market in their subsequent recommendations.* But you wouldn\u2019t know that if you just looked at their first 100 recommendations.\n\nSo what number of stocks is sufficient to be a reliable indicator of future returns? 200? 300? 500? 750? Well, the problem is that very few investment firms actually recommend this many stocks, so the data will be quite weak for a statistical analysis. But I did it anyway:\n\n||Correlation with subsequent returns|N|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|First 50|\\-0.083|66|\n|First 100|\\-0.062|58|\n|First 200|\\-0.086|35|\n|First 300|\\-0.079|24|\n|First 400|\\-0.241|21|\n|First 500|0.095|19|\n|First 750|0.293|15|\n\nNow, I want to say that this dataset is far from perfect. For instance, I think it\u2019s unreasonable to think that the performance of first 400 recommendations vs. subsequent recommendations are really that highly inversely correlated. At the same time, I think that if there really was a high correlation between early and subsequent performance, this statistical analysis could\u2019ve picked it up. As a final note, I will say that I trust this data more in light of previous research. Indeed a lot of research indicates that past performance does not correlate highly with future success. Famously, Daniel Kahneman has calculated the year to year correlation of professional investment advisors to be 0.01.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPast performance does not (meaningfully) predict future returns.",

If you find it stressful, try to avoid watching the news and continue investing as usual. Better yet: if you're young, cultivate a 'stocks are on sale' attitude and be glad you can keep buying at lower prices. Whatever you do, avoid short-term, split-second decision-making.\n\nHopefully, you've planned for bumps in the road. You have an emergency fund in cash (like a savings or checking account) as a baseline. Beyond that, you know your risk tolerance and have a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, including home country and international equities. If you feel stress-tested by all of this, consider waiting it out without taking any action at all (including: changing contributions). Then as things normalize, decide if maybe you should shift your stock/bond balance. Or if there is no recovery: sharpen some spears and start learning how to fish!\n\nBecause at the end of the day, things will recover. If they don't, your investments won't matter anyway. The biggest mistake you could make right now is capitulating and trying to time exits and entries. There are some chilling threads over on Bogleheads.org from the 08/09 crisis (a much bigger downturn!) filled with fear and (later) regret from panic selling. Every dip is different in its details, but if the past is any indicator, things will recover sooner or later.\n\nI have no idea if things will go up or down from here. I'm just rebalancing my allocation per my plan made years ago, and have only tweaked slightly along the way (and always in small ways and at non-volatile times). If you don't have a plan written down, it's worth doing - it can help you keep emotions in check and invested in various scenarios.\n\nBut in the words of The Dude: that's just, like, my opinion, man!\n\nMeanwhile, stay safe out there, folks, and stay the course.

Anyway this year he had a little book signing so I got in line with my book (a few years prior, I found the way people acted around him a bit silly, but by now I was a fan girl just like them), and as I got close the woman managing the line let me know he\u2019d only be signing his name, don\u2019t ask for anything else. I said \u201coh gosh, I\u2019m glad you told me, I was going to ask him to sign it to my son but of course I understand.\u201d \n\nWell I got up to him and I guess he heard because he said \u201cwhat is your son\u2019s name?\u201d And I said it\u2019s Ethan but really, sir, you\u2019ve done more than enough already.\u201d\n\nKnow what he wrote? \n\n\u201cEthan, listen to your mother. Jack Bogle.\u201d \n\nI really thought people deified him a bit the first time I went to one of these; I was there for straight up info and when people starting say \u201cJack\u2019s here\u201d in thrilled whispers I was a bit taken aback. But as I learned more about how much he went against the grain and started index funds when no one believed they made any sense, how hard he fought for the little guy\u2026well he has become more like a Woodie Guthrie to me, you know? \n\nAnd yes, my now 27 \n year old listens to his mother very closely, not on every subject, but definitely on saving and investing the Boglehead way.",

        "selftext": "## [Taxable account](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Taxable_account) - Bogleheads wiki\n\nBelow is an overview of taxable accounts: when to use one, how investments are taxed, and tax-minimization strategies/tips. It's specific to US investors / tax laws, though some of the general themes might be broadly applicable to other locales.\n\nI hope it's useful to folks less familiar with investing in taxable accounts, as well as those with more experience who haven't gone down the rabbit-hole of tax-minimization techniques.\n\n## When to invest in a taxable account\n\nInvesting in a taxable account is the final step in the /r/personalfinance \"how to handle money\" [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) / [flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png). Before that comes saving an emergency fund, paying down high-interest debt, saving for near-term goals, and maxing your tax-advantaged investment/savings options including:\n\n* Any employer retirement account or pension available to you - e.g. a [401(k)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/401(k)), [403(b)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/403(b)), [457(b)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/457(b)), [SIMPLE IRA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/SIMPLE_IRA), or [SEP IRA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/SEP)\n   * [Mega-backdoor Roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Mega-backdoor_Roth) contributions to your 401(k) or Roth IRA if supported by your employer's 401(k) plan\n* Your [HSA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Health_savings_account) if available\n* Your [IRA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/IRA) / [Roth IRA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Roth_IRA) if you have reported earned income (use [backdoor Roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Backdoor_Roth) procedure if over the income limit for direct contributions)\n* If saving for future education expenses, a [529 plan](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/529_plan)\n* Savings bonds: [I bonds](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/I_savings_bonds) or [EE bonds](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/EE_savings_bonds) provide state tax exemption &amp; federal tax deferral (or exemption if used for qualified education expenses, including funding a 529 plan)\n    * No need to max these, but consider gradually transitioning your emergency fund to I bonds (mindful of the 1 year lockup), and/or using these savings bonds for a portion of your bond allocation\n\nNote: the order above isn't  precisely prioritized/prescriptive; the recommended prioritization if all account types are available is: employer plan contributions to max any match, then HSA, then IRA / Roth IRA, then employer plan contributions up to limit, then 529.\n\nWhatever you do, don't be like the [roughly half of Robinhood users](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/brokerage-reviews/robinhood-review/) investing for the first time in a taxable account, using a brokerage that doesn't even support IRAs.\n\n## Taxation of taxable account investments\n\nIncome &amp; gains from investments in a taxable account are taxed as they are realized, with the tax rates depending on various attributes of the investment &amp; your income / filing status.\n\nIn general, you'll pay taxes on any:\n\n1.\tDividends (treatment / rate dependent on on issuer &amp; holding period; effective rate dependent on any foreign tax credit)\n2.\tRealized capital gains on selling (treatment / rate dependent on holding period)\n3.\tCapital gains distributions from mutual funds (treatment / rate dependent on underlying holding period within fund)\n4.\tInterest (taxed as ordinary income unless exempt due to issuer -- e.g. Treasury bond interest is exempt from state/local income tax, while municipal bond interest is exempt from federal income tax, and often state/local income tax in state of issue)\n\nFor stock ETFs or Vanguard stock index mutual funds with an ETF share class, only (1) or (2) apply -- (3) shouldn't apply for those types of Vanguard mutual funds because they [siphon out](https://www.investopedia.com/how-vanguard-patented-a-system-to-avoid-taxes-in-mutual-funds-4686985) capital gains via their ETF share class in creation/redemption trades.\n\n**Treatments**\n\nYou'll be taxed at long-term capital gains rates on:\n\n* qualified dividends (dividends from a qualified issuer/holding held for at least 61 days)\n* capital gains on holdings sold after being held for more than a year\n* long-term capital gains distributed by a mutual fund\n\nYou'll be taxed at ordinary income rates on the remainder:\n\n* non-qualified dividends (non-qualified issuer or holding period)\n* short-term gains (sold when held for a year or less)\n* short-term capital gains distributed by a mutual fund\n* non-exempt bond interest\n\n**Rates**\n\nTax rates by income bracket &amp; filing status may be found [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Qualified_dividend#Tax_rates). Note that the income thresholds are effectively higher / shifted due to the [standard deduction](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/standard-deduction). The long-term capital gains rates are applied by considering the long-term gains income as being stacked on top of ordinary income (including short-term gains).\n\n[This calculator](https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator) may be helpful in estimating your federal &amp; state tax burden for a given gain.\n\nThere's no automatic withholding of taxes on any of this taxable investment income (realized/distributed gains, dividends, interest). You may need to make quarterly estimated tax payments around the end of the quarter with this income, or increase any salary/paycheck withholding by submitting a new form W-4 to your employer, in order to avoid underpayment penalties later for not meeting the minimum payment or safe-harbor thresholds.\n\n## Minimizing taxes\n\nBelow is only a partial list of tax-minimization strategies with only a brief description of each; more-complete lists &amp; details may be found in the wiki under [Tax basics](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_basics#Taxable_accounts) and [Taxable account investing strategy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Taxable_account#Taxable_account_investing_strategy).\n\n* [Rebalancing with contributions](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Rebalancing#Different_rebalancing_approaches) \\- Try to rebalance to your target allocation using new money as much as possible to reduce tax implications around selling to rebalance. Turning off dividend reinvestment can help with this; direct dividends along with new money to funds below their target allocation.\n* [Tax-efficient fund placement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement) \\- E.g. try to keep non-municipal bond funds in a tax-advantaged account when possible, but ideally don't overweight them too much in a Roth account to avoid opportunity cost around higher tax-free compounded growth.\n* [Specific identification of shares](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Specific_identification_of_shares) \\- Ensure your brokerage account is configured so that when selling, you can select specific lots based on whether they individually have gains or losses, and their holding period.\n* [Tax-loss harvesting](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_loss_harvesting) \\- Have an itch to 'do something' when market prices drop? Consider tax-loss harvesting your recent lots, selling and immediately replacing them with roughly equivalent but not [substantially identical](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Wash_sale#Substantially_identical) funds (i.e. not the same fund, or another share class in the same fund like VTI/VTSAX, but another low-cost index fund tracking the same asset class).\n    * Note that this trades a tax break now for a higher potential tax burden in the future (because you lowered your cost basis). If your current long-term capital gains tax rate is lower than you expect it to be in the future, it may be unwise to harvest losses unless they would offset any short-term realized gains for the year (i.e. only harvest short-term losses if you have short-term realized gains, and only harvest long-term losses if you have only short-term realized gains).\n    * You need to be mindful of [wash sale](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Wash_sale) rules (avoid purchasing the sold security / a substantially identical fund within 30 days before or after the sale, in any account including tax-advantaged ones).\n* [Tax-gain harvesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/s69z9i/psa_taxgain_harvesting_may_reduce_your_future_tax/) \\- Does your income this year &amp; filing status qualify you for the 0% long-term capital gains tax rate? Take advantage of that by realizing gains while they're \"free\" (\\* caveats may apply).\n* Hold separate US vs international ETFs/funds in taxable -- 3 of the [benefits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/sxtt66/explanation_on_difference/hxu32xg/?context=3) of doing that are specific to taxable accounts, including opportunity to &amp; ease of applying the 2 preceding strategies, and ability to reliably claim the foreign tax credit. Holding VT/VTWAX in taxable? Consider tax-loss harvesting lots with losses into VTI + VXUS, or if you're in a situation where tax-gain harvesting seems beneficial, consider tax-gain harvesting lots with long-term gains.\n    * Note that if you're in that latter situation where tax-gain harvesting seems beneficial, it may be a bad trade to do tax-loss harvesting unless you\u2019ll have only short-term realized gains for the year, since offsetting long-term gains now isn't beneficial, and the higher gains in the future due to a lowered cost basis may be taxed at a higher rate.\n* Favor funds without capital gains distributions (i.e. ETFs or Vanguard mutual funds with an ETF share class, if the latter are available without transaction fees), and different funds than in your tax-advantaged accounts to help avoid [wash sales](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Wash_sale) &amp; ease tax-loss harvesting.",

Pension is not indexed. Inflation will eventually reduce its value. The way things are going, eventually may not be a real long time.\n\nSubstantial investment savings in 401K, Roth, taxable accounts - mid six-figures - Bogle-ish invested in US stocks:Ex-US stocks:Bonds:Cash 34:11:34:20. I know this is not optimum. I just adjusted some recently when I evaluated and found I was 56% in cash.\n\nPlenty of emergency funds for expenses - don't need much I'm never going to be laid off/unemployed with no income.\n\nPlenty of cash savings for a car, roof replacement, HVAC replacement, etc. I prefer to have money saved for this sort of thing rather than loans when they happen. Car is about time to replace, but it is a terrible time to buy one.\n\nI have received my inheritances. This is the end. I will never receive any new money so capital preservation is a concern. Received them recently. Currently mid six-figures parked in HYSA cash.\n\nNo debt or other obligations\n\nI grew up poor-ish and am constitutionally frugal. I can't change that. I don't enjoy travel beyond an hour or so in the car. It's painful to sit in a fixed position for long.\n\nMy greatest joy in retirement is not having to wake up to a screeching alarm clock. Pretty pathetic, I know, but it's my little slice of joy.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do investment wise? I know the 4-5% scheme to withdraw from investments for life, but I don't need to withdraw now, or maybe for years, other than 401K RMDs coming in a few years.

        "selftext": "If you are at Schwab and don\u2019t want to switch to Vanguard, this guide will show you how to\u2026\n\n-\tAutomatically invest 15% of your paycheck each pay period in 60% US, 40% INTL index funds. \n\nYou can easily change this allocation to your liking. But I\u2019ll use this for example\u2019s sake.\n\nBefore we begin. A couple notes worth mentioning:\n\n-\tYes, these are mutual funds, so they are a TINY bit more expensive in terms of cost basis than ETFs, but to you will make up more than that difference, just by having this system on autopilot.\n-\tThis part confused me at first: In order to set up auto investing with Schwab you must first OWN at least one share of the thing you want to set up auto investing for. So buy one SWISX and one SWTSX before you start this process I listed above. If you\u2019re confused call the Schwab support number. You\u2019ll get a human in 5 mins or less. They\u2019re excellent as I\u2019m sure you know.\n-\tThis frustrated me: Because there are several steps to setting this up which require fund transfers, it will probably take a week or 2 to get everything exactly as you want it. 15 minutes here\u2026 (wait 2 days for transfer to clear)\u2026 15 minutes there\u2026 etc. You won\u2019t be able to set the whole system up all at once. Just be patient. It\u2019s worth it once it\u2019s set up. \n-\tThe only true disadvantage I\u2019ve found to this approach is that I believe SWISX does not expose you to SMALL cap international stocks which may create a slight deviation in performance compared to say\u2026 \u201cTotal world excluding US\u201d funds such as VXUS at Vanguard. But again. I thought it was worth stomaching that small negative, for the huge positive of having auto investing in place.\n\nWe will be using Schwab\u2019s auto investing feature for mutual funds. It will take a bit of setup but once you get it set up it can automatically invest a percentage of your paycheck each pay period at your desired allocation. \n\nDo not confuse \u201cautomatic investing\u201d with Schwab\u2019s \u201cSchwab intelligent portfolios\u201d the intelligent portfolios thing is just schwabs robo advisor. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re looking for. \n\nTo find automatic investing:\n\nIn Charles Schwab, you have to go to \u201cTrade\u201d along the top menu, then click \u201cMutual Funds\u201d from the sub-menu, and then you\u2019ll see that you have two options \u2014 to trade mutual funds, or another option, \u201cAutomatic Investing,\u201d which lets you set up automatic investing instructions for funds that you\u2019re already in.  \n\nWithout further ado, here\u2019s how to set up the system:\n\n1.\tSet your checking account to make a scheduled transfer of 15% (or whatever percentage of your paycheck you want to invest each month) into your investment account at Schwab once per pay period, a couple days after you get paid. So if you get paid on the 1st and 14th of each month, set the transfers to happen on the 3rd and 16th just to allow time to be 100% sure that your check is fully deposited and available in your checking account.\n2.\tNow you\u2019ve got 15% of your check going into your investment account each month. Now you just need to auto invest it. So let\u2019s say you want to do 60% US, 40% international. And let\u2019s pretend that 15% of your paycheck is $1000 just for examples sake. Set Schwab auto investing to buy $600 of SWTSX and $400 of SWISX a few days after you have scheduled the money to transfer into your investment account. So In this case\u2026 on the 18th and 20th of each month. \n3.\tRebalance once a year. Aka, if your international has performed so well over the course of a year that it\u2019s grown to 70% of your portfolio when you want it to be 60%, then sell 10% of it and buy domestic U.S. SWTSX with it to keep your desired 60/40 US/INTL split. \n\n\nThere you go! Automatic investing!\n\nI hope this helps you! I\u2019ve been running it this way for awhile now and it\u2019s pretty worry free once you get it set up! Prevents my dumb monkey brain from trying to time the market or reallocate my percentages when little blips in the market happen. \n\nResources:\n-\tMe. Seriously. Send me a message if you have issues I\u2019d love to help. I researched this for hours and hours just to do it once. Might as well use that knowledge I have kicking around in my brain to help someone else haha. \n-\tSchwab support. They are really awesome and if you explain the concept of what you want to do they will help you with the technical aspects. \n\nHappy investing!",

Many of them are in regard to the market, FI/RE, saving, etc. This one stood out to me today as a fun one to link for the Bogleheads. \n\nWhat say ye, Bogleheads? I personally don't see any other way to invest. I simply don't have the skill or information necessary to trade effectively. Index investing is my only possible way forward. \n\nEven if there's a lost decade with zero returns ahead I'm still going to be indexing because 1) My account will still be growing via contributions and dividends, 2) I'm continuing to add  shares throughout that period, 3) At the end of that lost decade it's likely that those shares will increase in value similar to the 2010's. \n\nBuy and hold is the answer, IMO.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-lost-decade-through-2031-zero-returns-stifel-2022-3](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-lost-decade-through-2031-zero-returns-stifel-2022-3)\n\n**The stock market faces a lost decade of zero returns through 2031, according to Stifel's chief equity strategist. Here's how investors should prepare.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Investing in stocks over the next decade is going to get tough for those that simply buy and hold.**\n* **That's according to Stifel's chief equity strategist, Barry Bannister, who foresees a lost decade for stocks.**\n* **Here's how investors should prepare for the potential of 0% returns in the US stock market through 2031, according to Bannister.**\n\n \n\nThe next decade won't be as easy as the last one was for investors in the US stock market, according to Stifel's chief equity strategist, Barry Bannister.\n\nInstead of the [S&amp;P 500's](https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&amp;p_500?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) compounded annual rate of return of more than 13% during the 2010's, investors should prepare for the likelihood of a lost decade ahead, or returns of 0% in the US stock market from the end of 2021 through the end of 2031, Bannister told Insider in an interview on Wednesday.\n\nWhile that might sound crazy to the [millions of investors that discovered the stock market](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-investing-covid-pandemic-new-easy-apps-2020-9?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) for the first time amid the COVID-19 pandemic and were conditioned to expect new highs after every sell-off, it's not out of the question.\n\nIn fact, it just happened, relatively speaking, with the stock market delivering a compounded annual rate of return of -0.9% during the 2000's. That decade started at the peak of the dot-com bubble and ended near the depths of the Great Financial Crisis.\n\n\"Over two centuries, 20-year returns \\[in the stock market\\] have always been positive in both real and nominal terms...but over 10-years, you could lose money,\" Bannister said.\u00a0 \n\nBannister's outlook for poor stock market returns ahead is driven by elevated valuation metrics, a local high in the percentage of stock ownership among households, as well as the potential for serious geopolitical risks.\u00a0\n\n\"As long as the laws of supply and demand exist, we're going to have \\[supply chain\\] disruptions, geopolitical rivalries, fiat currencies, indebted governments, populism, and \\[profit\\] margin and regulatory pressure,\" Bannister explained.\n\nSome of this has already started to play out in 2022, with [Russia's attack against Ukraine](https://www.businessinsider.com/live-updates-russia-ukraine-crisis-2022-2?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) raising geopolitical tensions to new heights. The invasion has led to an exacerbation of supply chain disruptions and massive price rises in everything from [wheat](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/wheat-prices-today-limit-up-russia-ukraine-invasion-bread-basket-2022-3?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) to [oil](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/oil-rallies-for-a-3rd-day-while-european-natural-gas-prices-trade-just-below-record-highs-after-russia-threatens-to-turn-off-the-taps/articleshow/90078264.cms?utm_source=flipboard&amp;utm_medium=flipboard_rssfeed&amp;utm_campaign=flipboard_referral) to [nickel](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/nickel-price-russia-ukraine-war-short-squeeze-lme-suspends-trading-2022-3?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets).\n\n\"I would say that the locking up of Russian reserves was as big of a watershed moment as when Nixon got the US off the gold standard in 1971. This told the world that they need to find alternative reserve currencies for their assets.\"\n\nIf Bannister's view is correct, that could strengthen foreign currencies like the Chinese yuan at the expense of the US dollar.\n\nGeopolitical tensions could get even worse if China invades Taiwan, which Bannister believes is a given.\n\n\"Xi Jinping is not going to die without making a try \\[for Taiwan\\],\" Bannister said, noting that given his current age a move against Taiwan is likely to happen by the end of this decade. And on top of that, Iran is likely to resurface as a geopolitical hotspot in the 2020's, according to Bannister.\n\nSo how can investors eke out a positive return over the next decade? According to Bannister, simply buying and holding the S&amp;P 500, a strategy that has done remarkably well since 2009, is not the answer.\n\n***\"Buy and hold is the ideal strategy in the bull phases...but in the down phases, being in the index is not going to generate a positive return. Investors who are passive are going to suffer,\" Bannister said.***\n\nInstead, investors should allocate to real and alternative assets including commodities, real estate, and the more active long/short stock picking strategies often employed by hedge funds. Within the equity space, value stocks should outperform growth stocks, while international stocks are likely to outperform US stocks, according to Bannister.\n\nIn the short-term, Bannister admits there is room for upside in the S&amp;P 500, with a potential relief rally to as high as 4,600. But those rallies [should be sold rather than bought,](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-sell-relief-rally-prolonged-drop-stifel-2022-3?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) because like in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, a 20% counter-trend rally in the market is possible amid a broader down-trend.",

Problem being, a beater home on the outskirts of NYC costs 600k, 700k minimum. My family\u2019s here so I\u2019m not particularly interested in moving in the near future. \n\nI know diversification of assets is important, but I\u2019m failing to see how a house is in any way advantageous. Can someone maybe critique my thinking? I\u2019d love to hear alternate points of view. \n\nAssuming I\u2019m buying a house/condo to live in, and not rent out\u2026 it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. At my age, I feel like the biggest thing to focus on is asset accumulation. With the recent market downturn (not timing the market, but objectively we are not at an ATH), I feel like buying up as many shares in index funds right now is the best thing I can do for my future. \n\nTo buy a 700k home, I\u2019d need 20% down to avoid PMI. That\u2019s a 140k down payment!! I would have to sit on cash that\u2019s depreciating really quickly, and amass 140k to my name before I even think about buying. That also seems like an opportunity cost to not invest. \n\nThen there\u2019s closing costs, property taxes, the interest payments on the mortgage. What scares me is that anything that goes wrong in a house, is my responsibility to fix. As someone who is not great with their hands, presumably that means hiring contractors for renovations or fixes. Which means I also need large cash reserves on hand, which speaks to, again, opportunity cost. \n\nEven worst case projections indicate the stock market can yield 4% real returns, but real estate can be 0-1.5% real, plus all the cash I need on hand, plus being in a ton of debt without flexibility, plus having risk associated with a physical asset. Even when I pay off the mortgage it\u2019s not liquidity - it\u2019s just \u201cworth something\u201d I can\u2019t cash in or use. \n\nI am 100% in equities at my age. 80% US/20% INTL split and only buy index funds - VTI/VXUS primarily. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand for the life of me how buying a house makes sense. The stock market seems like the clear winner, financially speaking. The insane amount of cash I need to have on hand at all times seems like such a sunk opportunity at my age.\n\nAny general thoughts?

You can&amp;#39;t guess what P/E ratio the market will assign in the future so don&amp;#39;t try\n\nThe Investors Manifesto\n\n- Gordon&amp;#39;s Equation\n    - Expected return = dividend yield + dividend growth rate\n    - The average dividend growth rate for the U.S since 1870 has been about 1.5% per year. The US economy has grown at about 3% during this time. The difference can be explained by share dilution.\n    - This explains why some fast-growing emerging markets can actually be bad investments. If total share dilution is growing faster than they economy, you will have a negative return\n    - Don&amp;#39;t use past returns in your estimates. Use the Gordon equation.\n-\tHomes are NOT investments. At best you will get a real 1% return after factoring in maintenance, taxes, insurance, etc., and more likely 0%. It is a place to live and nothing more.\n-\tOne way to calculate a home&amp;#39;s fair market value is to take the estimated rental and multiply it by 150. Example - $2,500 rent x 150 = fair value of $375,000\n\n4 Pillars\n\nMath \u2013 Chapter 2\n\n-\tDR \u2013 Discount Rate \u2013 Amount we expect to get from the market. IE 8% Return\n-\tTwo times this century, investors have demanded a 15% DR.\n-\tHigh DR = high perceived risk, high returns, depressed stock price\n-\tLow DR = low perceived risk, low returns, elevated stock price\n-\tPV \u2013 Present Value\n-\tDR and PV are inversely related. Higher DR = Lower PV or Lower DR = Higher PV\n-\tThe risker the situation, the higher the DR we demand, and the less that asset is worth to us\n-\tFood companies DR is lower because their earnings/dividends are more stable. Compare this to the DR of an auto company who has a higher DR because their earnings are more erratic. This is why cyclical companies with erratic earnings sell cheaper than say food companies\n-\tIt is impossible to do this with a single security. Because if the company falters, then your math will be off. But for the market as a whole. It will work because it evens out. The income stream of the market as a whole is more reliable. You can also use this formula in reverse.\n  - Fisher&amp;#39;s Dividend Discount Method (DDM) - Market Value = Present Dividend / (DR - Dividend Growth Rate)\n-\tHistoric DGR is 4.5 - 5%\n-\tThe above equation does not predict the short-term future. You can make it say whatever you want. One book even predicted a 36,000 Dow based on this formula in 2000\n-\tGordon Equation \u2013 As close to financial law as you can get. Accurate way to predict long term stock returns (20-30 Years)\n  - DR (Market Return) = Dividend Yield + Earnings Growth\n-\tThis formula has been extremely accurate. It predicted a 9% (4.5% Yield + 4.5% Growth) growth the last century and the actual growth was 9.89%.\n-\tIf a company doesn&amp;#39;t pay dividends, their long-term return would roughly be the same as their aggregate earnings growth. IE \u2013 10% earnings growth would get 10% return. But the long-term average corporate earnings and dividends growth is 5% and has not changed in 100 years.\n-\tRemember, if the average annualized earnings growth is about 5%, the annualized stock price increase must be very close to this number. Unless they are buying shares or selling shares. Then the growth rate will increase or decrease by that amount. IE \u2013 company has 5% growth and bought back 5% of outstanding shares = 10% growth. Or company has 5% growth and sells 5% of outstanding shares = 0% growth. But for the market as a whole, this evens out.\n-\tGordon Equation works with bonds too. You just put the DGR at 0. Market Return = Dividend Yield\n-\tOver short periods (less than 20 years) changes in the dividend yield or PE multiple account for most of the stock markets return. This is the &amp;quot;speculative return&amp;quot; of the market. The short-term return of the market is purely speculative and cannot be predicted.\n-\tLong term increases in the stock market value is entirely the result of long term dividend growth and dividend yield calculated from the Gordon Equation or &amp;quot;fundamental return&amp;quot; of the market\n-\tRalph Wanger analogy of the market = The market is a very excitable dog on a very long leash in NYC, darting randomly in every direction. The dog&amp;#39;s owner is walking from Columbus Circle, through Central Park, to the Met. At any moment, the is no predicting which way the dog will lurch. But in the long run, you know he is headed Northeast at 3 mph. The problem is that almost all of the market players have their eye on the dog and not the owner.\n-\tIf public confidence is low, DR will rise and asset prices will fall, which will increase subsequent returns. The opposite is also true. This means the worst possible time to invest is when the skies are the clearest. The best possible time to invest is when the skies are darkest. You are going to be investing against the grain if you want good returns.\n-\tDR seems quite sensitive to prior stock market returns. This means a rising stock market lowers DR and perceived risks which drives up prices. Then you get the vicious cycle. The same thing happens in reverse during recessions/depressions.\n-\tThe immediate past is not predictive of the future\n-\tAsset classes have a tendency to revert to their mean over periods longer than 3 years\n-\tMean revision means that periods of relatively good performance tend to be followed by periods of relatively poor performance. The opposite is also true. But this is not a sure thing.\n-\t1993 Fuller study showed that popular growth stocks with high P/E ratios increased their earnings 10% faster than the market in year 1, 3% faster in year 2, 2% faster in year 3 and 4 and 1% in years 5 and 6. Eventually their high P/E ratios come down and with it their returns. In other words, you can expect a growth stock to increase its earnings, on average, about 20% more than the market over 6 years.\n-\tExample of above \u2013 and why you don&amp;#39;t invest in growth stocks\n  - Smokestack has a P/E of 20 and Glamour has a P/E of 80\n    - For every $100 of Smokestack stock it earns $5. 100/20 = 5\n    - For every $100 of Glamour stock it earns $1.25. 100/80 = 1.25\n    - If SS grows its earnings at 6% for 6 years it will increase earnings by 48% from $5 per share to $7.40 per share\n    - If Glamour grows is earnings 20% faster than the market over 6 years. It will increase earnings by 78%. 1.48 x 1.20 = 1.78. So, its earnings will grow from $1.25 to $2.23. After that it will have the same earnings growth as SS. The market will see the earnings slowing down and clobber its shareholders\n-\tThere are no patterns to the market. You can&amp;#39;t predict them. Just because the market behaved a certain way one time doesn&amp;#39;t mean it will repeat\n-\tIf history did repeat itself, the wealthiest investors would be librarians\n-\tThere are some pieces of data that have worth. Like housing starts or the length of the average industrial working week. The problem is that everyone knows this information too and it is already being factored into the stock and bond prices. Something that everyone knows isn&amp;#39;t worth knowing yourself.\n\nRational Expectations\n\n- Irving Fisher noted that the value of any investment was simply the stream of future dividends, discounted by the risk adjusted expected rate of return\n  1. Return = Current dividend yield + historical dividend growth rate\n  2. R = Yield + G\n- For the last 150 years, after inflation (Real) dividend growth is about 1.5%\n- If dividend on the S+P 500 is 2% for example then add the real dividend growth rate of 1.5% = 3.5% expected real return\n- This is what Vanguard founder John Bogle called the fundamental return of the market.\n- The other part of the return is the &amp;quot;speculative return&amp;quot;\n  1. Return = Dividend yield + Growth + Speculative return\n  2. &amp;quot;Speculative Return&amp;quot; is due to change in short term valuations of stocks (P/E&amp;#39;s, etc.)\n- Over short periods, the speculative returns are the driver of stock returns. But over long terms, it is the fundamental return that is key.\n- Your job as an investor is to (as best you can) ignore the speculative return (Short Term) in order to earn the fundamental return (Long Term)\n- No one knows what the speculative return will be and if they did, they wouldn&amp;#39;t tell anyone\n- Shiller&amp;#39;s CAPE 10 ratio is another great way to estimate returns\n- The fair value CAPE 10 ratio is probably about 20. Up from its historic 16.5\n- Just like the P/E average is around 20, up from its historic 15.\n- A rebalancing bonus can among stock asset classes can be viewed as a kind of risk premium for betting that stock asset classes will revert to the mean and produce similar long-term returns\n- In other words, Asset class returns tend to revert to the mean or there would be no rebalancing bonus\n\nIAA\n\n- The best way to estimate future stock returns is the DDM (Dividend Discount Method)\n  - Return = Dividend Yield + Dividend Growth Rate + Multiple Change\n    - Dividend yield is the yield on the investment (Example \u2013 2020 S+P 500 yield is 1.5%). The Dividend growth rate is historically 5%. And the Multiple change refers to the increase or decrease in the overall P/E ratio.\n    - The Dividend yield and dividend growth rate is the fundamental return (easy to estimate). The Multiple change is the speculative return (impossible to estimate).\n- An optimizer will heavily favor those assets with high historical or assumed returns. This is a problem because asset returns have a tendency to &amp;quot;mean revert&amp;quot;.\n  - Don&amp;#39;t use an optimizer to try to develop an asset allocation. We can&amp;#39;t predict returns, standard deviations, or correlations accurately enough. And if we could, we wouldn&amp;#39;t need one anyway.\n    - And optimizing historic returns is a one-way ticket to the poor house\n- A well-diversified portfolio is not a free lunch. It does not come anywhere near eliminating risk. You will still suffer loss from time to time\n  - The benefit is also psychological because you are getting into the habit of buying low and selling high. Thus, profiting by moving in the opposite direction of the market\n- Stocks outperform almost all other assets in the long run because you are buying a piece of our almost constantly growing economy\n  - But then investors make the mistake of thinking the most profitable stocks to own must be those of the most rapidly growing companies (Growth Stocks)\n- Long term returns are usually higher when valuations are cheap and lower when they are expensive\n- Paul Miller did the first study on cheap stocks called the Dow P/E strategy. He examined buying the 10 lowest P/E stocks in the Dow from 1936-1964 and discovered that the lowest P/E stocks (those everyone hates) actually outperformed the market and the highest P/E stocks (those everyone loves) greatly underperformed\n\n- Dividend Discount Method (DDM) formulated by John Burr Williams in 1938 was formulated by a simple idea. Since all companies eventually go bankrupt, the value of a stock, bond or the entire market is simply the value of all its future dividends discounted to the present.\n  - And since a dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today, its value must be reduced or discounted to reflect the fact you won&amp;#39;t receive it today.\n    - The reduction is called the Discount Rate (DR)\n      - The DR is determined by the cost of money (Risk Free Rate) plus the risk to the lender\n        - Safer investments have a lower DR and risker investments a higher DR\n      - DR can also be thought of as the expected return of the asset\n        - Lower risks = lower DR = Lower expected return/Higher Present Value\n        - Higher risks = higher DR = Higher expected return/Lower Present Value\n      - Formula \u2013 Reasonable Price = (Annual Dividend Amount)/(DR \u2013 Dividend Growth Rate)\n        - But you can make this formula say anything you want depending on your inputs. So be careful with this formula\n\nAsset Allocation\n\n- A research firm did an analysis on inflows and outflows (1986-2005) from equity mutual fund investors, it showed that the average investor earned just 3.9% vs 11.9% for the S+P 500\n  - Why? Mostly due to chasing the performance of funds that had recently done well\n  - Investment return is far more dependent on investor behavior than on fund performance\n- Research studies repeatedly show that most money managers underperform the market\n  - Professionals populate the marketplace and by definition, the majority cannot outperform the average. And this will continue to be true\n- Some managers with superior skill do exist, the problem is they are rare and very difficult to identify conclusively\n- Modern Portfolio Theory considers each asset class not as an end in itself but rather as it stands in relationship to all others in the portfolio\n- No liquid investment alternative with stable guaranteed principal exist that can provide real returns by consistently beating the combined impact of inflation and taxes\n- Simple Average Return vs Compound Annual Return\n  - Example \u2013 If I invest $100 and I get a 25% return year 1 and a -20% return in year 2.\n    - Simple average return (Arithmetic return) is 2.5%. 25%-20%/2 = 2.5%\n    - Compound Annual Return (Geometric return) - $100 x 25% = $125 x -20% = $100 or 0%\n      - For any series of returns, the simple average return will ALWAYS be higher or equal to the compound annual return\n      - The difference between the simple average and compound annual is larger for highly volatile returns.\n      - Only in a situation where returns are consistent will the returns be equal\n        - The reason in the disparity is that it requires a larger percentage of above average performance to offset a given percentage of below average performance\n          - Simple average is ok to use in a single period\n          - Compound return is more appropriate to use when comparing returns over multiple periods\n- You should be concerned not only about an asset class historical return but also about the dispersion of those returns and the likelihood that future returns will be higher or lower than past returns\n  - People often anchor their return expectation to an investments long term historical return. The average return could be an unlikely result\n- The TIPS spread provides a market-concensus forecast of future inflation\n  - Equal to the difference between the yield to maturity of a conventional treasury bond and the yield to maturity of a similar TIPS bond\n- The median normalized P/E ratio for 1926-2011 is 16.45\n  - Higher current P/E ratios signal lower future returns\n  - Lower current P/E ratios signal higher future returns\n  - But there is a range to these outcomes\n  - P/E ratio and 10-year returns following\n    - Below 9 = Average 15.09%\n    - 9-11 = Average 15.40%\n    - 11-14 = Average 12.99%\n    - 14-18 = Average 10.9%\n    - 18-25 = Average 6.46%\n    - 25+ = Average 3.07%\n      - Range was -1% on the low to 6% on the high\n- Market timing doesn&amp;#39;t exist, but people want to believe it is possible\n- Over 11 cycles post WWII\n  - Median bull market was up 79%, bear market was down 28%\n  - Median bull market lasted 2.5x as long as the median bear market\n- A study by Robert Jeffrey concluded: No one can predict the market&amp;#39;s ups and downs over a long period, and the risks of trying outweigh the rewards\n  - Most of the &amp;quot;positive action&amp;quot; in stocks in compressed into just a few periods, which (perversely but understandably) tend to follow particularly adverse times for stocks\n- Much of the problem with market timing is that a disproportionate % of the total gain from a bull market tends to occur very rapidly at the beginning of a market recovery\n- Percent you must be right to make marking timing a viable strategy\n  - 80% bull and 50% bear\n  - 70% bull and 80% bear\n  - 60% bull and 90% bear\n- Do not invest in stocks unless you are in it for the long run\n- Most people do not think in terms of expected returns and standard deviation.\n  - They think in terms of the chance of loss\n- For any series of returns, the larger the standard deviation, the more the compound annual returns (geometric) drop below the simple average return\n  - Volatility therefore impairs the compounding of returns\n  - If I have 2 investments, both with the same 10% simple average return and one has a higher standard deviation than the other, the investment with the higher standard deviation will have a lower compound annual return.\n- An ideal investment would be inversely correlated assets with similar returns. But they don&amp;#39;t exist in real life.\n  - If you had 2 investments with 10% simple average return and a negative correlation, the compound annual return would be 10% also.\n    - This doesn&amp;#39;t exist though in real life; it would be too good to be true\n- Most investments in real life that have similar return patterns have a slightly positive correlation to each other. Although differing in degree, most financial classes are positively correlated to each other\n  - If you have 2 portfolios with the same 10% simple average return, the one with the lower volatility will have the higher compound annual return.\n- Having assets with similar return profiles and slightly positive correlations will reduce standard deviation and therefore improve the compound annual return of the portfolio. Even if the correlation is just mostly or slightly positive, it still provides a benefit\n- Historic data is helpful in understanding asset class volatility and return characteristics and relationships. But precise answers to future portfolio AA decisions simply are not possible. The perfect AA is not possible except in retrospect\n- A portfolio that minimizes portfolio volatility for a given expected return or maximizes portfolio expected return for a given level of risk is said to be efficient\n\nA Random Walk Down Wall Street\n\n- Technical analyst looks at charts and patterns (They don&amp;#39;t exist). They believe the market is 10% logical and 90% psychological and attempt to beat the crowd with their picks. Does not work.\n- Fundamental analyst believe that the market is 90% logical and 10% psychological. Caring little for patterns and past price movements. Fundamentalists seek to determine a stocks proper value. Value applies to assets, growth rates, earnings and dividends, interest rate, and risks. They believe that the company&amp;#39;s price will eventually reflect its real worth\n- God Almighty does not know the proper P/E multiple for a common stock\n- The history of stock price movement contains no useful information that will enable an investor to consistently to outperform a buy and hold strategy\n- Technical analysis strategies are usually amusing, often comforting, but of no real value\n- The past history of stock prices cannot be used to predict the future in any meaningful way\n- Technical analysis enriches people marketing them, not investors\n- The idea is simple, if past prices contain little to no useful information for the prediction of future prices, there is no point in following any technical trading rule for the timing of purchases or sales. A simple policy of buying and holding will be at least as good as any technical procedure. Also, buying and selling short term generate taxable events, brokerage charges, and spreads that decrease returns\n- Analysts&amp;#39; recommendations are tainted by very profitable investment banking relationships\n- Brad Barber studied the performance of the &amp;quot;strong buy&amp;quot; recommendations and found the results were terrible\n- Systemic Risk AKA &amp;quot;Market Risk&amp;quot; \u2013 arises from the basic variability of stock prices in general and the tendency for all stocks to go along with the general market, at least to some extent. Cannot be eliminated by diversification\n- Unsystematic Risk \u2013 results from factors peculiar to that specific company. IE \u2013 strikes, new products, management, etc. This can be eliminated through adequate diversification. With as few as 60 stocks.\n- Beta \u2013 relative volatility or sensitivity to market moves\n  - Numerical description of systemic risk\n  - It is a comparison between the movements of an individual stock or portfolio and the movements of the market as a whole\n  - IE \u2013 the total stock market has a Beta of 1. If a stock has a Beta of 2. It will move up or down 2x as much as the total market. +-10% change in the total market would mean a +-20% change for the stock. Beta of 0.5 would be +-5%\n- Investors will not be paid for bearing risks that can be diversified away. The is the logic behind the capital asset pricing model\n- As the systemic risk (Beta) of an individual portfolio increases, so does the return an investor can expect\n- Beta isn&amp;#39;t the end all be all though. Fama and French did a study in 1992 that discovered that there was no relationship between returns for portfolios and their beta measures. It is not a useful single measure to capture the relationship between risk and return\n- It appears that the only way to obtain higher long-run investment returns is to accept greater risks\n- Unfortunately, a perfect risk measure doesn&amp;#39;t exist. Beta and rate of return has not corresponded to the relationship predicted in theory. Beta can also change.\n- In the short run, change in valuations can have a major role in determining returns. IE \u2013 P/E&amp;#39;s and Dividend yields\n- P/E have varied widely. During the early 2000&amp;#39;s with high optimism, the P/E&amp;#39;s were about 30. During 1982 stocks sold at only a P/E of 8\n- P/E go up with lower interest rates and go down with higher interest rates because now equities have to compete with bonds\n\nStocks for the Long Run\n\n- Real stock returns in the 19th century do not differ appreciably from the real returns in the 20th century\n- Stocks fluctuate both below and above the trendline but eventually return to the trend. AKA mean reversion. This means that periods of above average returns tend to be followed by periods of below average returns and vice versa\n- In the short run, stock returns are very volatile driven by changes in earnings, interest rates, risk, uncertainty and psychological factors\n- The stock market has real annualized returns of 6.7% from 1802-1870, 6.6% from 1871-1925, and 6.4% from 1926-2012. This is remarkable constancy\n- As stable as the long-term returns for equities have been, the same cannot be said of fixed-income investments. Real returns on treasures were 5.1% in the early 19th century to a bare 0.6% since 1926, only slightly above inflation\n- Real return on bonds have shown a similar but more moderate decline as fixed-income. 4.8% in the first period to 3.7% in the 2nd period and now only 2.6% in the current period.\n- The excess return of stocks over bonds is referred to as the equity risk premium.\n- Subtracting stock and bond returns from equity shows that the premium has averaged 3% against bonds and 3.9% over treasury bills over the last 200 years.\n- 19 countries were analyzed from 1900-2012 and it was determined that the US experience of equites outperforming bonds and bills has been mirrored in all countries examined. Every country achieved equity performance that was better than bonds.\n- While the US and UK have performed well, that is no indication that they are out of line with other countries. Therefore, studies on the US market results have relevance to all investors in all countries\n- Swings in investor sentiment from political or economic crisis can throw stocks off their long-term path, but the fundamental forces producing economic growth have always enabled equities to regain their long-term trend\n- Correlations between asset classes can and do change over time\n- During 20 year holding periods, stock have never fallen below inflation. Bond and treasury bills have lagged by as much as 3% below inflation\n- The worst 30-year timeframe since 1802 stocks beat inflation by 2.6%.\n- As the holding period increases, the odds that stocks will beat bonds or bills increase drastically\n- On any given 2-year cycle, there is a 33% chance bonds or bills will beat stocks\n- Under a paper money standard, bad economic times are more likely to be associated with inflation, not deflation like the 1930&amp;#39;s. Under these circumstances, stock and bond prices tend to be more correlated. Thereby reducing the diversifying qualities of government bonds\n- Because of this it is unlikely that bonds will remain a good long-term diversifier, especially if inflation looms once again\n- Real returns (post tax) since 1913 (income tax enacted) have ranged from 6.1%-2.7% on stocks, 2.2% to -0.3% for bonds and bills having a 0.4% to -2.3%\n- Taxes have the greatest impact on fixed income investments\n- Since 1871, for someone in the highest tax bracket, short term treasury bills have had a negative real return after tax\n- The inflation tax hits harder when the holding period is shorter. The more you buy and sell, the more frequently the government can tax the gains, which might not be real after inflation\n- P/E ratio is the ratio of a stock&amp;#39;s price to its earnings. The average P/E is 15 from 1871-2012\n- Earnings yield is important also. It measures the earnings generated per dollar of stock market value. IE \u2013 if the P/E of the market is 15 means the earnings yield is 1/15 or 6.67% which is historically accurate long-term rate of return on stocks. This is not a coincidence. If the P/E went to 20 it would be 1/20 or 5%.\n- But there have been changes in the economy and markets that may rise the average P/E in the future. These changes include a decrease in the cost of investing in indexes, a lower discount rate, and an increase in knowledge about the advantages of equity vs fixed income investing.\n- There are many reasons for a decline in real returns available to investors. Whatever the reasons, such a decline implies that the real return on equity need not be as high as it had historically been to attract investors. The historic equity risk premium was 3-3.5%. If we assume the long-run real rate is somewhere around 2%, then a 3% equity premium will require a 5% real return on stocks, which, gives us an average P/E of 20. 1/20 = 5%\n- Transaction costs have come down and this has led to a higher P/E ratio than in the past\n- The equity risk premium also itself may have shrunk. There is considerable truth in the statement that widespread knowledge of the profitability of common stocks, gained from the studies that have been made, tends to diminish the likelihood that correspondingly large profits can be gained from stocks in the future. The competitive bidding for stocks causes prices at the time of purchase to be high\n- Investors are drawn to firms able to generate high earnings and revenue growth. But empirical data shows this pursuit of growth often leads to subpar returns. IE \u2013 IBM vs Exxon 1950-2012. Exxon was a better investment\n- Financial theory has shown that if capital markets are &amp;quot;efficient&amp;quot; in the sense that known valuation criteria, such as earnings, dividends, cash flows, book values, and other factors are already factored into the security price, investing on the basis of these fundamentals will not improve returns.\n- In an efficient market, the only way investors can consistently earn higher returns is to undertake higher risk, where risk is defined as the correlation of an asset&amp;#39;s return with the overall stock market. This was the basis for the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) or Beta\n- Beta and CAPM was the primary basis for stock returns in the 1970&amp;#39;s and 1980&amp;#39;s. Unfortunately, beta and CAPM did not prove effective in explaining the differences in returns among individual stocks\n- Don&amp;#39;t use Beta to try to buy stocks, it doesn&amp;#39;t work\n- Fama and French wrote an article that showed there are 2 factors (size and value) that are far more important in determining a stock return that the beta of a stock\n- Although the historical return on small stocks has outpaced large stocks since 1926, the magnitude of small cap outperformance has waxed and waned unpredictably.\n- The existence of a small-cap premium does not mean they will outperform large stock every year or even every decade. They have lost to large cap for more than a decade before.\n- F+F also determined that value played a role in returns. Stocks with low prices relative to their fundamentals are value stocks. Stocks with high prices relative to their fundamentals are growth stocks\n- In 1978 Ramaswamy and Litzenberger established a significant correlation between dividend yield and subsequent return. O&amp;#39;Shaughnessy has shown that in the period of 1951-1994, the 50 highest dividend yielding large cap stocks had a return that was 1.7% higher than the market\n- Basu did some studies in the 1960&amp;#39;s that showed that stocks with lower P/E ratios have significantly higher returns than stocks with high P/E ratios, even after accounting for risks\n- Graham wrote in Security Analysis (1940) that people who habitually pay more than 16x average earnings are likely to lose considerable money in the long run\n- P/B ratio is a good ratio but there are conceptual problems with using book value as a value criterion. It does not correct for changes in the market value of assets, not does it capitalize R+D expenditures. From 1987-2012 the author determined that book value underperformed either dividend yields or P/E ratios in explaining returns\n- The worst course an investor can take is to follow the prevailing sentiment about economic activity. That will lead investors to buy at high prices when times are good and everyone is optimistic and sell at the low\n- Since 1885, there have been 145 days where the market moved 5% or more. Only \u00bc of those days can be attributed to an event. This confirms the unpredictability of the market and the difficulty in forecasting moves\n- News moves markets. But the timing of much news is unpredictable, like wars, political developments, and natural disasters\n- Markets do not directly respond to what is announced, rather, they respond to the difference between what the traders expect to happen and what actually happens. The market already incorporates all the information that was expected\n- For example \u2013 a strong economic report can send stocks down. Why? Because even though the news is good for main street and corporate earnings, it can mean the federal reserve will raise interest rates, which raises the discount rate at which these future profits are discounted\n- The opposite can also happen. A weak report can send stocks higher as interest rates decline\n- A lower than expected inflation report lowers interest rates and boosts bond and stock prices. Inflation worse than expected raises interest rates and depress stock and bond prices\n- Although fascinating to observe and understand a market&amp;#39;s reaction, investing on the basis of data releases (CPI, unemployment, etc.) is a tricky game and best left to speculators. Most investors will do well to watch from the sidelines and stick to a long-term investment strategy.\n- From 1971-2012, the average U.S. equity active mutual fund returned 1% below the Wilshire 5000 index and 0.88% below the S&amp;amp;P 500 index.\n- Very few active managed mutual funds beat the index and the odds of you picking on early are low. Good money managers are extremely difficult to identify as luck plays a role in all successful investment outcomes\n- The generally poor performance of active mutual funds is not because the fund managers pick losing stocks. It is because of the fees and trading costs\n- Contrary to their oft articulated goal of outperforming the market averages, investment managers are not beating the market; the market is beating them\n- Investing $1000 with a compound return of 11% will accumulate 23,000 in 30 years. A 1% fee will reduce this number by 1/3. A 3% fee will reduce it to just over 10,000. The fees add up.\n- In the 1990&amp;#39;s passive investing took off. Indexing has low fees. Most investors are better off in a capitalization weighted index fund\n- Indexing also has a problem in that when a company is announced it will be added to an index, the price usually goes up forcing the index to have to pay inflated prices\n\nWinning the Losers Game\n\n- Investment managers are not beating the market, the market is beating them\n  - Over 1 year, 70% of professionals underperform their benchmarks\n  - Over 10 years, 80%\n  - Over 15 years, 90%\n- Yes, some professional money managers will beat the market in any given year. But most will not over the long term and there is no reliable way to figure out who would be in that 10% that outperforms ahead of time\n- Investment professionals daily trading volume by decade\n  - 10% in the 1960&amp;#39;s to over 90% currently.\n- This is why it is so difficult for active managers to beat the market\n- Understanding the outlook for the near term is easy as J.P Morgan said, &amp;quot;It will fluctuate.&amp;quot;\n- One way to be realistic about future returns is to assume that future range of P/E multiples and corporate profits will be within their historical upper and lower limits and will appear with frequency at values close to the long-term average\n- Investors almost always project recent past market and economic behavior out into the future, somehow expecting more of the same to continue\n  - Math example \u2013 If dividends are at 1.5% and corporate earnings are growing at 4.5% (Historical Average), then a composite of 6% return is reasonable. This is the fundamental rate of return the investor can expect from the market\n  - Then you add or subtract the changes in P/E over that time frame. The average P/E in recent decades has been about 15.5. This is the speculative return component\n- Predicting the market roughly is not hard, but predicting it accurately is impossible\n  - Predicting where the market will be in the long run is not hard, but even estimating how it will move in the next few months is impossible and pointless\n\nOne up on Wall Street\n\n- If the company insiders are buying, you should too. Management normally sells 2.3 shares for every 1 share they buy. In 1987 after the crash, it was 4 buys for 1 sell\n- Avoid the hottest stock in the hottest industry, any stock being touted as the next X\n- A share of stock is NOT a lotto ticket. It is a part ownership of a business\n- P/E ratio can be thought of as the number of years to earn back your original investment. IE = P/E of 10 would be 10 years assuming earnings stay constant. Ratios tend to be lower for slow growers and highest for the fast growers with cyclicals in between depending on the current cycle.\n- Look at average P/E ratios on the company you are researching and peers going back several years to determine if it is a good buy\n- Avoid stocks with HIGH P/E ratios. They must have incredible earnings growth to justify the price\n- P/E ratio that is half the growth rate (annual earnings) is very positive and one that is twice the growth rate is very negative. IE = P/E of 10 should be growing at 10%\n- Formula = Growth rate plus dividend yield divided by P/E. IE = 12% growth + 3% yield/10 P/E = 1.5. Less than 1 is bad. 1.5 is ok and 2+ is great.\n- The stock market as a whole has its own collective P/E ratio, which is a good indicator of weather the market at large is over or under valued. If some stocks are selling at inflated prices relative to earnings, then it could be likely most stocks are selling at inflated prices.\n- Interest rates have a large effect on p/e ratios as investors pay higher p/e when interest rates are lower and bonds less attractive\n- Dividend paying stocks keep the stock price from falling as far as if there was no dividend\n\nHow to Calculate Estimated Returns\n\nhttp://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/403/fairy.htm\n\nJunk Bond Math\n\nhttp://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/401/junk.htm\n\nLarry Swedroe Book Summaries\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/sdqtl7/larry_swedroe_the_incredible_shrinking_alpha/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/sdqrf0/larry_swedroe_the_only_guide_to_alternative/\n\nMy Summaries and FAQ\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/captmorgan50/comments/rnftyk/book_summaries/",

Why would I own bonds, if my 100% stock portfolio has higher expected return?\"*\n\nCliff Asness (director of quantitative research at Goldman) provides a great answer in his **[1996 paper in the Journal of Portfolio Management, \"Why Not 100% Equities\"](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Journal-Articles/JPM-Why-Not-100-Equities.pdf?sc_lang=en)**. I encourage you to read the whole thing, it's only 5 pages.\n\n-----\n\nHere's a summary of quotes and main points - but for real, just read the paper:\n\n* \"Perhaps the most important lesson of modern finance is that under certain assumptions, the choices of 1) which risky assets to hold, and 2) how much risk to bear are independent choices.\"\n\n    * Step 1: \"Construct a set of efficient portfolios (portfolios with the most expected return for a given amount of risk).\"\n\n    * Step 2: \"Choose which of these efficient portfolios to hold.\"\n\n* The best risk-adjusted returns are obtained by diversifying not only across the stock market, but also across asset classes. \"Bonds and stocks are both part of an efficient portfolio.\"\n\n* A 60/40 stock-bond portfolio with modest leverage has higher returns than a 100% stock portfolio, with equal volatility:\n\n  | Portfolio             | Compound Return | Standard Deviation |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| 100% Stocks           | 10.3%           | 20.0%              |\n| 100% Bonds            | 5.6%            | 6.8%               |\n| 60% Stocks, 40% Bonds | 8.9%            | 12.9%              |\n| Levered 60/40         | 11.1%           | 20.0%              |\n\n    * Over a 40-year investment horizon, the 0.8% difference in return between the \"100% Stocks\" and \"Levered 60/40\" portfolios compounds up to around 40%, with the same amount of volatility.\n\n* \"Although the 100% stock portfolio has outperformed the 60/40 portfolio, it is not necessarily the portfolio that does so with the least risk.\"\n\n* Even ignoring leverage, \"it is only under very special circumstances that 100% stocks is the optimal portfolio.\"\n\n-----\n\nThe author also makes some points about leverage:\n\n* A 60/40 portfolio with a modest amount of leverage can has historically had drawdowns (\"worst cases\") that are comparable to those of a 100% stock portfolio.\n\n* Some investors feel like using any amount of leverage in investing is \"inviting disaster\", but this is often not a carefully-considered belief. (In reality, most investors are *already* investing with leverage - any investor with a mortgage is leveraged. Going to college with the help of student loans is leveraged investing.)\n\n* Most people can access leverage at near the risk-free rate, if not directly, then by options on indices. (A modern alternative would be to invest in mutual funds / ETFs run by institutional investors following your preferred strategy, such as [NTSX](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/capital-efficient/ntsx) (roughly, 1.5x 60/40) or [PSLDX](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/mutual-funds/stocksplus-long-duration-fund/inst) (roughly, 2x 50/50).)\n\n    * Interestingly: in 2019, [Vanguard removed the ability to trade leveraged ETFs through their platform](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/leveraged-inverse-etf-etn), but they made a sole special exception for NTSX, which is still tradeable on their platform to this day.\n\ntl;dr: If you're invested in 100% stocks, you're giving up around 0.8% per year of return due to lack of diversification across asset classes.",

        "selftext": "I'm 36. Started applying the Boglehead philosophy last year after receiving a low six-figure inheritance on top of experiencing a change in jobs that more readily allowed me to put money away for retirement. That's later in life than I would have ideally liked to have begun this journey, but based on my investment plan over a 30-year horizon and what I'm regularly able to put away now thanks to my current job, I know I'll be fine. This post isn't about that though.\n\nIn my mid-20s, I didn't know anything about investing, and didn't have any genuine interest in learning about smart ways of putting away money. I was great at putting booze away though for nearly a decade.\n\nI wanted a way to view the costs of my drinking history in a way that concretely measured the damage I have done, and I realized that the Boglehead approach could actually be used to that effect. I'm sure it's telling that I was able to start my journey as a Boglehead sooner than I was able to quit drinking, but after this little exercise, I am absolutely done with drinking.\n\nI decided to ask myself a question that I knew, in advance, was going to be unsettling once I knew the answer, but I believe that facing up to it constitutes genuine accountability: **What if I had taken all the money I was spending on booze over a decade and invested it instead?**\n\nFor approximately 10 years before this point, I was spending approximately $400 a month on booze. It was mostly spent on cheap rum to mix with cokes on a near daily basis, and I had occasional glasses of wine or beers over the weekends *on top of that.*\n\nSo with that number in mind, let's get to it.\n\n**Q1: How much would $400 invested every month for 10 years be worth now if it were instead put into an investment vehicle with an assumed annual return rate of 7%?**\n\nFor my calculations, I'll be using [this calculator.](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html) I don't want to quibble much over the selected annual return rate, but I'll be using 7% in all my calculations. And these are idealized calculations in the sense that we obviously don't know what the exact behavior of the stock market is going to be any timeframe.\n\nEntering a starting amount of $0, with $400 invested at the end of each month for 10 years, the total value of my contributions and interest:\n\n**$68,420.69**\n\nOkay, so that's $68,420.69 I would have had today. Knowing that obviously sucks. But if you fully appreciate the value of compound interest, you know that this is only just the beginning.\n\nLet's say I correct the behavior and I put my future sums of $400 a month that I would have spent on alcohol instead into investments though that appreciate at the same annual return rate.\n\n**Q2: Assuming I now redirect money I would have otherwise spent on booze to investing in an investment vehicle with a 7% annual return rate, how much will money will be that worth in 30 years?**\n\nI enter a starting value of $0 with $400 invested at the end of each month for 30 years with the same annual return rate. The value of my contributions + interest generated after that time:\n\n**$467,781.04**\n\nThis is the money I am going to have when I instead invest what I otherwise would have pissed away on alcohol. But this still is not anywhere close to being the most important takeaway. \n\nIf you don't already fully appreciate the value of compound interest, this next question will cement it.\n\n**Q3: Let's assume I did have that $68,420.69 to invest right now and I invest it for 30 years, but I contribute *absolutely nothing* extra in monthly contributions. I just let it compound. How much then is this worth in 30 years assuming an annual return rate of 7%?**\n\nI enter a starting value of $68,420.69, the 7% return rate, 30 years, and $0 as the amount I'd contribute at the end of each month. The total after this period:\n\n**$520,835.74**\n\nIn other words, letting the original $68,420.69 just compound for 30 years with no additional contributions yielded more money alone than putting away $400 each month for 30 years. \n\nAnd that is why compound interest is the Boglehead's best friend.\n\nLet me restate what this all means: I spent $400 a month on booze over 10 years. If I had instead invested this money in assets with an annual return rate of 7% in those 10 years, that's $68,420.69 (Q1). Letting that sum just compound for an additional 30 years would result in $520,835.74 (Q3). But adding in $400 monthly contributions over those same 30 years would have yielded an extra $467,781.04 (Q2)\n\nIn other words, if all along I was investing $400 a month across 40 years, **that's close to 1 million dollars.** But because of how I pissed this money away on booze for the first 10 years, I'll be out $520,835.74 after all 40 years.\n\nAnd now that I have seen this number, I know I can never drink again. Because this is a number I am going to remember for the rest of my life.\n\nThank you for reading. Hoping this provides perspective to anyone who might need it. And if this makes you feel better about your own choices, I'm honestly okay with that.",

I just found this subreddit, any insight would be helpful!",

        "selftext": "Hi, so my parents have had a financial advisor forever and last year I mentioned the option of doing index funds.  I got my parents bogle's books.  We've been reading them and they agreed it was a good idea.  The advisor buys and sells individual stocks causing large capital gains taxes every year.  If my parents had indexed, their capital gains taxes would be nowhere near what they are now because there would not be constant buying and selling.  The advisor obliged last year to move all sales of individual stocks when he would normally have a sale to VTI and the bonds to BND.  The issue now is that anytime we speak with him he keeps pointing out the successes he has with the individual stocks and the failures of VTI and BND under similar periods.  Truthfully, over the years in total he has not beaten the index.  But recently he keeps pointing to quarterly successes of certain stocks and recent failures of BND and VTI.  I think we are at a point where our investing style no longer matches the advisor and it's causing a conflict.  My parents still need a hand held even though they'd like to transition to indexing.  We would like to find an advisor that charges hourly rates instead of a percentage of assets to help us plan this out.  Is this something that is available or is there a website for such advisors and is there a way to find one that is completely in line with the boglehead train of thought?  Thanks in advance bogleheads!!",

Bumps are large. But we get over them.\n2. In our foolish focus on the short-term stock market distractions of the moment, we, too, often overlook thislong history\n3. It is dangerous...to apply to the future inductive arguments based on past experience\n4. In the short-term, stock prices go up only when the expectations of investors rise, not necessarily when sales, margins, or profits rise\n5. ignore the short-term noise of the emotions reflected in our financial markets and focus on the productive long-term economics of our corporate businesses\n6. The true investor . . . will do better if he forgets about the stock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the operating results of his companies.\u201d\n7. When there are multiple solutions to a problem, choose the simplest one\n8. owning the stock market over the long term is a winner\u2019s game, beating the stock market is a loser\u2019s game.\n9. over the long term, the miracle of compounding returns is overwhelmed by the tyranny of compounding costs\n10. The winning formula for success in investing is owning the entire stock market through an index fund, and then doing nothing. Just stay the course\n11. The greatest Enemies of the Equity investor are Expenses and Emotions\n12. Fund returns are devastated by costs, taxes, and inflation\n13. SELECTING WINNING FUNDS in advance is more difficult than it looks\n14. Even funds with solid long-term records go out of business\n15. a fat wallet is the enemy of superior returns\n16. Before you rush out to invest in these three funds with such truly remarkable long-term records, think about the next 35 years\n17. \u201cDon\u2019t look for the needle in the hays tack. Just buy the hays tack!\u201d\n18. there is simply no way to assure success by picking the funds that will beat the market, even by looking to their past performance over the long term. In fund performance, the past is rarely prologue avoid per- formance chasing based on short-term returns,especially during great bull markets.\n19. \u201cBuying funds based purely on their past performance is one of the stupidest things an investor can do.\u201d\n20. you can be more successful in selecting winning funds by focusing, not on the inevitable evanescence of past performance, but on something that seems to go on forever or, more fairly, a factor that has persisted over all the fund industry\u2019s long history.\n21. the more the managers and brokers take, the less the investors make\n22. Hold Index Funds That Own the Entire Stock Market.\n23. Do your best to diversify to the nth degree; minimize your investment expenses; and focus your emotions where they cannot wreak the kind of havoc that most other people\n24. All index funds are not created equal\n25. Your index fund should not be your manager\u2019s cash cow. It should be your own cash cow.\n26. In inefficient markets, the most successful managers may achieve unusually large returns. But common sense tells us that for each big success, there must also be a big failure.\n27. Indexing stock market sectors, a strong idea. Betting on stock market sectors, a weak reality.\n28. Always avoid bond funds with sales loads. smart investors will save themselves lots of money\u2014and substantially improve their returns\u2014if they apply the same principles of broad diversifi- cation, low-cost, no-load, minimal turnover, and long-term investing when they select fixed income funds\n29. Never think you know more than the market. Nobody does.\n30. \u201cThe greatest enemy of a good plan is the dream of a perfect plan.\u201d Stick to the good plan.\n31. If you like the idea of sector ETFs, use the appropriate ones,don\u2019t trade them, and use them in the right way\u2014 sparingly,and only to diversify your portfolio.\n32. \u201cUnsoundly managed funds can produce spectacular but largely illusionary profits for a while, followed inevitably by calamitous losses\n33. \u201cthe real money in investment will have to be made\u2014as most of it has been made in the past\u2014not out of buying and selling but of owning and holding securities, receiving\n34. I see no reason why investors should be content with results inferior to those of an indexed fund.\n35. The two sources of the superior returns of the index fund:(1) the broadest possible diversification; and (2) the tiniest possible costs.\n36. smart investors ought to figure out for themselves that pouring money into hot funds in hot markets, and pulling money out of those funds when they turn cool, often in cold markets, is a loser\u2019s game\n37. Over the short run, illusory speculative returns, caused by the impact of the change in the amount investors are willing to pay for each dollar of corpo- rate earnings, can increase or decrease investment returns. But in the long run, the impact of specula- tive return washes out\n38. The best protection for individual investors from the risks inherent in individual stocks is the broadest possible diversification.\n39. In your Serious Money Account, 50 percent to 95 percent in classic index funds. In your Funny Money Account, not one penny more than 5 percent.\n40. We know that we must start to invest at the earliest possible moment, and continue to put money away regularly from then on.\n41. We know that investing entails risk.

We know that the risk of selecting specific securities, as well as the risk of selecting both managers and investment styles, can be eliminated by the total diversification offered by the classic index fund. Only market risk remains.\n44. We know that costs matter, overpoweringly in the long run, and we know that we must minimize them.\n45.

The thing about this quote is that it's flawlessly good advice... for young people.\n\nThe problem is that the older you are, the less time you have in the market, and so the less the advice applies. Imagine a 90 year old being given this advice, how would it be of any use to them? \"Don't worry great grandpa, in 20 years it will all even out!\"\n\n\"Dude, just put in x% of your income every year and don't worry about it, it will all be fine in 30 years\" is well and good when you're 25 or 35, but what if you're 65, or 75?\n\nPeople who are near retirement or in retirement don't have all that much time in the market. They don't have anything new to put in, but (hopefully) they have a bunch of wealth that they have to figure out what to do with. Do they want to sit there with $500,000 worth of stocks which might possibly become $400,000 worth of stocks and then go nowhere for 10 years, as they then pull money out of it and it shrinks more each year?\n\nEveryone, if they live long enough and manage to save, will eventually reach the point where \"time in the market\" isn't on their side any more, and they will have to figure out how to time the market. They will have to figure out if they want to buy into or hold in their current market, and whether this makes sense given the current conditions.\n\nSo \"time in the market beats timing the market\" is not the ultimate pinnacle of investing wisdom. Everyone will (hopefully) live long enough to see it become useless advice. And then they'll have to make real decisions as to where to put their money.",

        "selftext": "I have seen several posts over the past few weeks wondering if now is a good time to invest due to \"current events\" (war in Ukraine, rising interest rates, etc). Here is some reflection on these events:\n\n**Is it a good time to invest?** Yes it is always a good time to invest. As has been proven over and over again, time in the market is the greatest benefit for investors, just ask [Bob](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/).\n\n**But what about \\[insert news story here\\]?** Here is a list of things (mostly US centered) that have happened since January 1, 2000: Bush v Gore, 9/11, dot com bubble/recession, two different wars that have lasted longer than a decade, anthrax attacks, Great Recession, the \"lost decade\" (2000-2010), Jan 6 insurrection, Covid shutting the world down, introduction of smart phones, social media, Brexit, 5 different Presidents (Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden), gay marriage becoming legal across the US, 17 different people have served on the Supreme Court (I'm counting Ketanji Brown Jackson, since she has been confirmed), rise of China, people predicting the world will end \"soon\".\n\nAs you can see there has been a lot of things that have happened, both good and bad, and the US and the World have survived, and provided great returns over the past 20ish years. No matter when we look, there were always be stories that make it seem like \"this time is different,\" but yet the world's economy just keeps moving on with an upward trajectory.\n\n**I can't handle the current downward trend in my portfolio, what should I do?** I have 3 things to say to you:\n\n1. Take a break from looking at your portfolio/news. Take a vacation.\n2. Remember we are \"long term investors.\" Even someone who retires at 65 can still have 20-30 years of investing before they die, and even longer if they want to leave an inheritance.\n3. Rethink your asset allocation. If you feel that this current trend is still too much for you to handle, you may be too aggressive with your assets. Look into holding bonds (BND, BNDW, I bonds, GOVT). Now when the markets start to rebound, don't ditch your bond allocation (remember you added bonds for a reason). If you are worried about rising interest rates and bonds, read [this](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=360575).\n\n**How long will this downward trend continue?** I have no idea. It may end next week or two years from now (the S&amp;P had [3 consecutive years of negative returns in 2000, 2001, and 2002](https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns)). The best thing to do is to stick to your [investment policy statement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement).\n\n**But inflation.** Well, yes it is high. However, inflation was bad back in the mid 70s to 80s also (10+%). I have yet to see an \"updated\" version to BuisnessWeek's August 13, 1979 article \"[The Death of Equities: How Inflation is Killing the Stock Market](https://ritholtz.com/1979/08/the-death-of-equities/)\" (there have been updates, stating that equities have been great since then). The stock market has done pretty well over the past 40+ years.\n\nWe also don't have [WIN buttons](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/museum/artifactcollectionsamples/catagories/win/buttona.html) yet (yes that was a thing back in the 70s).\n\n**TLDR:** Stay the course, and don't get distracted from the fact that today's news will have little effect on your portfolio years down the road.",

        "selftext": "One of the questions I've periodically thought about is about the market going up. The market has continuously gone up over the decades and the index, which tracks it, goes up along with it.\n\nA few skeptics wonder: *\"How high can the market keep going? It has to peak at some point right?\"* And they use that reasoning to not invest in index funds because they feel the market has already peaked or will peak at some point.\n\nBut theoretically, if the market stopped going up (and thus the index), aren't we all screwed? Isn't the economy and everything related to IRA, retirement, and 401(k)? I mean, aren't a large number of retirement funds invested in index funds?\n\nI would feel like this point would be good reason to keep investing no matter what, no?",

These comments are very helpful -- apologies, it sounds like I shouldn't have called it a crash since it's more of a \"downturn\". If anything I wonder now if I should be investing *more* now that the market is down, but I think my plan now is to just setup auto-investing where I can then stop looking at it everyday. I do feel like personally it helps me to look at the number of shares rather than the price. Thanks all,",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Thank you to everyone who commented and offered REALLY helpful advice. I am taking it all to heart and making a plan. Glad I found this sub. :)\n\nI posted a similar thread in the FIRE sub, but I thought I might get more guidance from this thoughtful group.\n\nI'm feeling very lost, discouraged, and overwhelmed right now with the situation we have with our Financial Advisor.\n\nMy husband has been with this advisor for ten years. When we got married we combined everything under the same advisor. I grew up extremely poor so I became an excellent saver, but investing has always confused and scared me. Because of that, I was more than happy to have someone else handle things. My husband is the same way. He works a minimum of 50 hours a week and has no time or energy to invest in trying to wrangle investments.\n\nWe checked in with this person once a year and everything looked good. He shows us fancy charts that say we are on track for retirement. Last year I became interested in FIRE and decided I wanted to attempt to retire early. I started looking at our accounts more, not really understanding but at least digging around for the first time. I saw that we are paying $22K towards whole life insurance each year. I don't even remember agreeing to insurance. A quick Google of WLI made my stomach drop. Meanwhile, our 401K accounts are not maxed out and there are many different areas we could use $22K a year other than insurance.\n\nI emailed our advisor immediately and said I wanted to get out of the WLI. You can imagine how that went. I feel taken advantage of and angry. But now, I'm so lost and I don't know how to get out of this. Every single asset we have (except work 401Ks) is with this person. I don't even begin to know how to unravel from them, but I also no longer have any trust and don't want them managing my money. I've called several other fee-based advisors, but they all want a percentage to manage the portfolio. Currently what our advisor manages is roughly a worth of $400K.\n\nI don't really want anyone to fully manage it. I want someone to help me draw a map and then I can call them if I get lost, but I don't want them on the road trip if that makes sense. My husband is very unsure about leaving this advisor as he doesn't have confidence that we can manage the money ourselves and build enough for retirement.\n\nI don't know how to surrender the WLI policies in the correct way or move accounts from the advisor to something else without major financial or tax implications. I've tried to learn as much as I can online, but it just leaves me frustrated and depressed. I'm also overwhelmed trying to comb through the millions of choices for term life to replace the WLI, now that we are older (40s/50s) it is more expensive and harder to get.",

        "selftext": "# **Behavioral and Historical Finance**\n\n# **William Bernstein The Delusions of Crowds: Why People Go Mad in Groups**\n\n4 Signs of a bubble\n\n1.\tEveryone around you is talking about it. And you should start worrying when people talking about getting rich in certain areas of the market don&amp;#39;t have a background in finance\n2.\tWhen people begin to quit their jobs to speculate in the markets\n3.\tWhen someone exhibits skepticism about the prospects and people don&amp;#39;t just disagree with them, but they do so vehemently. They usually say &amp;quot;You just don&amp;#39;t get it.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;New Era&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is different this time&amp;quot;\n4.\tWhen you start to see extreme predictions.\n\n-\tHuman beings intuitively seek out outcomes with very high but very rare payoffs, such as lottery tickets, that on average lose money but tantalize their buyers with the chimera of unimaginable wealth\n-\tResearchers have found that our brains fire not only with reward, but even more intensely with its anticipation.\n  - There is nothing so disturbing to one&amp;#39;s well-being and judgement as to see a friend get rich\n-\tWhen presented with facts and data that contradict our deeply held beliefs, we generally do not reconsider and alter those beliefs appropriately. More often, we avoid contrary facts and data, and when we cannot avoid them, our erroneous assessments will even harden and make us more likely to proselytize them.\n-\tPeople respond more to narratives than to facts and data. And the more compelling the story, the more it erodes our critical thinking skills\n-\tWe have 2 different types of thought process\n  - System 1 or &amp;quot;reptilian brain&amp;quot; that is fast moving emotional response\n  - System 2 or &amp;quot;evolutionary brain&amp;quot; that is much slower conscious reasoning\n    - Our faster emotional machinery leads, and our slower &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot; follows\n    - In a state of nature, the advantages of system 1 are obvious (IE - hissing snake at your feet). But in a relatively safe post-industrial world where dangers have a longer time horizon, system 1 dominance often occurs at great costs\n-\tBank supplied leverage is the fuel that powers modern financial manias and it has brought with it a roller coaster of bubbles and busts\n  - Over the last 4 centuries, financial innovation has yielded a dizzying variety of investment vehicles: each, in its turn, was often simply leverage in a slightly different disguise and would prove the tinder that would set alight successive waves of speculative excess\n-\tBubbles typically end with a seemingly small disturbance, followed by a swift collapse\n-\tThroughout history, property prices have ranged between five and twenty times annual rental values.\n-\tWhen investors are unhappy with ultra-low interest rates offered on safe assets, they bid up the prices of risk assets with rosier potential income.\n  - The allure of the hypnotic new technology (early 1800&amp;#39;s railroads) was amplified, as is almost always the case with bubbles, by falling interest rates, which makes investment capital more plentiful\n-\tEvery bubble carry within it the seeds of its own destruction\n-\tWhen compelling narrative and objective fact collide, the former often survives.\n-\tHuman beings suffer from confirmation bias, in which once they have settled on a hypothesis or belief system, pay attention only to data that supports their beliefs and avoid data that contradicts it.\n-\tHyman Minsky thought bubbles needed 2 conditions\n  - Easy credit via low interest rates\n  - Advent of new technology\n-\tInvestors excited about new technologies, or financial products, etc. begin to pour money into them. Since these assets can also be used as collateral for loans, rising prices mean that speculators can borrow even more to pour into these assets. A self-reinforcing cycle develops. But only on the way up\n-\tMinsky developed the &amp;quot;instability hypothesis&amp;quot; which states that in a safe and stable financial environment, money inevitably migrates away from safe borrowers and toward risky ones. Eventually, things get out of hand, resulting in a blowup, which makes lenders and investors more prudent, and the cycle begins anew. Usually about once per decade\n  - Amnesia is implicit in the instability hypothesis. After a crisis, investors shy away from risk. As markets recover and the unpleasant memories fade, participants become more open to risk and the instability cycle begins anew.\n  - We all like a good story; in the grip of a bubble, when faced with the unpleasant or difficult calculation, a compelling narrative provides easy escape from the effort of rigorous analysis.\n-\tAbandonment of hardheaded financial calculations in favor of compelling narratives is another factor that precipitates financial manias\n  - Rather than attempt the nearly impossible estimation of the value of a stock with high projected future earnings (South Sea in 1720, RCA in 1928, Pets.com in 1999, or Tesla today) investors default back to the simple heuristic: &amp;quot;X is a great company and it is going to change the world, and its worth paying almost any price for it.&amp;quot;\n-\tHumans have a recency bias: If stock prices have been rising for the past several years, they will come to believe that equity levels will continue to do so forever; as prices climb, shares become more attractive, which drives up prices even more. The reverse also happens during bear markets\n-\tJohn Templeton &amp;quot;The four most expensive words in the English language are &amp;#39;This time it&amp;#39;s different.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;\n-\tMax Winkler observed after the 1920 crash and discovery of the Dividend Discount Model that the market discounted not only the future, but the hereafter as well\n-\tDebt can grow faster than the rest of the economy for so long before they implode\n  - This is particularly true of private debt\n-\tDuring bubbles, people become intoxicated by the pursuit of effortless wealth\n-\tEven if we can&amp;#39;t model bubbles, we know what they look like\n-\tMinsky&amp;#39;s amnesia requirement usually reveals a generational divide during bubbles; only participants old enough to recall the last boom and bust are likely to be skeptical. Their younger and more enthusiastic colleagues will deride them as old fogies\n  - Bubbles are the province of young people with short memories\n-\tMarket Bubbles require 4 necessary conditions\n  - Technological and financial displacement\n  - Credit loosening\n  - Amnesia of the past\n  - Abandonment of time-honored valuation principles\n-\tUnder most circumstances, the Federal Reserve cares about 2 things\n  - Overall state of the economy (as measured by GDP growth and unemployment)\n  - Keeping inflation under control\n    - Stock prices are of lesser concern and often wind up a bystander of the other 2 policies\n-\tThe Fed primary operates via the federal funds rate (interest rate at which member banks lend to each other overnight)\n  - When interest rates on these are high, they attract investors. Which pulls investment from risk assets (stocks) and lowers their prices. The opposite is true\n-\tWe are apes who tell stories. When our remote ancestors needed to communicate with each other to survive, they did not do so with syllogisms, numerical data, or mathematics. The primary mode of that communication was and still is narration.\n-\tHumans are narrative animals, no matter how misleading the narrative, if it is compelling enough it will nearly always trump the facts, at least until those facts cause great pain.\n  - The more compelling the narrative, the more it erodes are analytical thinking\n  - We also mold the facts to fit our preexisting opinion\n    - We cling to facts that fit our narrative and ignore those that disconfirm them\n    - We intentionally avoid exposing ourselves to contrary data\n  - A compelling narrative can spread through a population just like a virus would and can even acquire critical mass\n    - As more and more people share the same delusion, the more likely we are to believe in it, and so the more likely those around us will do so as well, a vicious cycle ensues, gaining more and more momentum until they finally smash into the brick wall of reality.",

        "selftext": "Whenever people *stop* talking about a recently hot strategy, I feel the urge to check in on it and see why that might be. The two components of HFEA are **UPRO** (3x leveraged 500 index) **and TMF** (3x leveraged long-term Treasuries). These **are currently down ~45% and ~50%, respectively** YTD. One of the big 'selling points' of this backtest-driven strategy was that it not only had good returns, but  *also* that it held up 'OK' during pretty big downturns, with its *worst* loss being around 50% during the Great Recession (though backtesting too far gets fuzzy, but I digress). A few more weeks at this rate, and it could pretty easily exceed that even in this much shallower pullback.\n\nAnyway, the implicit promise seemed to be: if it didn't do so much worse than, say, a mostly-stock portfolio in *that* particularly dire period, then anything *short* of that it should weather without a huge drawdown. But here we are. For comparison with 60/40 UPRO/TMF I input a 60/40 balanced fund of US stocks and bonds. *Edit: because HedgeFundie draws more on risk comparisons with 100% US stocks, I added that, too.* Here are the results, YTD:\n\n* **Standard balanced 60/40 portfolio: -12%**\n* **100% US stocks: -17%**\n* **HedgeFundie leveraged 60/40 portfolio: -42%**\n\nSo, what happened? The [HFEA portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=272007) backtested well during a period of primarily declining interest rates and overall good returns for the US market. It also benefited from flight-to-safety effects in sudden and severe crashes (bonds helping offset stock losses). But add some inflation, rising rates, and a bit of a stock downturn, which a normal portfolio handled rather well, and the whole thing starts to show its weaknesses in a spectacular fashion.\n\nThere's a lesson here, and it's one that shows up over and over again in different forms: don't rely on backtesting alone and ending up fighting 'the last war.' Build a diversified portfolio to weather various circumstances. Or at the very least: be sure you understand *how* and *why* your approach might get hit hard at times. YMMV.\n\n**Edit to add:** some folks are complaining that this is a 'cherry-picked' time period. Here's the thing: cherry-picking can indeed be bad if you're trying to extrapolate out future expectations (e.g. ARKK did amazing for a year, so I infer it should do amazing forever). But zooming in to understand how portfolio assets work together (or don't) under different economic conditions to stress-test a portfolio in a downturn (e.g. peak to trough) can help inform asset allocation. This isn't a fringe opinion or anything new -- it's a cornerstone of Modern Portfolio Theory. Critically examining the first big drawdown of a newer strategy (only a few years old in this case) is the *least* we can do.",

It was all very unexpected as it took forever for everything to be processed. The windfall was in the high six figures and I decided to deposit these funds in a new bank account so I could compartmentalize and avoid lifestyle creep with the account I use for my day to day life. \n\nWell the sum raised some eyebrows at this new bank and their financial advisors called me a few days after this deposit. At this point I had a taxable account and a Roth that I\u2019d been making monthly contributions into. My AA was roughy 90/10 between VT and GOVT. I followed the sub and owned the book, so I knew I was going to be a passive investor for the long haul. But the much larger account kind of put some pressure on me that I\u2019d never felt before. So I took a meeting with the financial advisor for this bank branch. \n\nI thought they may have some interesting points on taxes, asset allocations, or something interesting that I maybe hadn\u2019t thought of before. \n\nI was dead wrong. I was basically presented with three plans. An advisor lead plan with their local guy, a bank lead plan with an all in one portfolio, and some front loaded mutual funds. The entire thing was just a sales pitch for high expense ratio products, the lowest being the bank lead mutual fund at about 1%. The financial advisor I was speaking with had a 1.5% fee and was actively trying to sell me on 5% front loaded funds. I kinda strung the meeting along a bit for my own curiosity, but I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be paying these exorbitant fees. \n\nThat meeting was in February, I\u2019ve taken the time since then to pay down all debt, max my tax advantaged accounts, and come up with an AA. I\u2019m basically just going to DCA it all into a three fund over the next year. I\u2019d planned for four equal installments, the first was going to be next Tuesday. Up until I got a call from this FA today. \n\nI let it go to voicemail. The jist of his message was that he could still see that I hadn\u2019t invested any of the money in my account. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to do anything sitting in cash. We have some very conservative options if you\u2019re afraid of volatility.\u201d \n\nI was planning on Tuesday anyhow so I figured I\u2019d move my timeline up a few days as a bit of a middle finger to exorbitant fees and grifters if he could see my investment account. So I bought in today and now I feel great.\n\n$125,000\n\n55% VTI, 35% VXUS, 10% GOVT",

        "selftext": "If you made a single large investment and had unfortunate timing (January 2000), your inflation-adjusted annual return of the sp500, including reinvested dividends, would only be 4.3% over the past 22 years. And after the first 13 years (January 2013), you would have still been in the red, not keeping up with inflation.\n\nI often see the sentiment, \"just invest in stocks, you'll get a 10% return (or 7% inflation-adjusted).\" While this is may be the historical long-term average for the SP500, it's important to realize that your investment could still be in the red even a decade later. Some young investors take it for granted that the market always bounces back quickly, but it's important to realize that you need a long time horizon. Instead of, \"buy the dip\", maybe they should say, \"buy the dip and wait 20 years.\"\n\nTo be fair, I've obviously cherry-picked bad timing. If you had been lucky to invest at the bottom, your returns would have beaten the average. It also helps if you had a steady income to continue investing incrementally over time, regardless of the level of the market.\n\nThe neat website below let's you run these simulations.\nhttps://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/\n\nEDIT: I'm NOT at all suggesting to avoid stocks. I'm just saying that it's important to understand that when people say, \"expect 7% return\", there's a big \"plus or minus\" after it, which people forget to mention. If people understood this better, we'd see less posts saying, \"I inherited $100k that I want to use for a down payment in a few years, but now it's down 15%, what should I do?\" I would also pose that assuming a 7% inflation-adjusted return is too aggressive when making retirement plans, because there's a 50/50 chance you'll be below that average, and there's a realistic possibility of being far below it.\n\nEDIT 2: Yes, it would be far more informative to simulate the much more common scenario of investing more every year (such as when saving for retirement) than just a lump sum. That would be a great future project. It takes more work and data mining, especially to go back ~100 years, so if anyone knows of this study already existing, please share. I'm sure it's been done before.\n\nBonus question: What inflation-adjusted return do you assume in your retirement projections? For stocks? And for bonds?",

        "title": "Unpopular Opinion: More People Should Use Target-Date Funds (TDFs)",
        "selftext": "The r/Bogleheads subreddit sees many threads where people are asking what fund they should invest in. Personally, I don't believe that Target Date Funds (TDFs) get nearly the recommendation that they deserve. This is especially pertinent to threads of young / newer investors.\n\nFar too much weight is put on being able to have control, fees, etc., and not enough weight is placed on more important things like savings rate.\n\nInvestors in the US have experienced a massive bull-run with equities, and there are a lot of new investors who don't know that stocks don't just always go up. They've never really experienced a major drawdown, and may not have a real handle on their risk tolerance. For these new investors, a TDF that coincides with their reasonable expected retirement date is still going to be very aggressive (e.g., 90/10) according to historical recommendations (e.g., 75/25 rule, age in bonds, etc.). Even seasoned investors can benefit from a simple \"put money in and forget about it\" strategy where they're less likely to tinker due to recent performance.\n\n**Fees**\n\nWith regard to fees, it is a Boglehead mantra that you want to limit the fees that you spend on your investments, as these are a fixed cost regardless of the performance of the fund.\n\nMy push towards TDFs is entirely based on access to low-cost index TDFs. **Index**\\-based TDFs from reputable firms are typically well below a .20% ER fee (some firms offer actively-managed TDFs for a significantly higher fee, and this post does **NOT** advocate those). A few examples of current fee structures at some reputable firms are:\n\n1. Vanguard: .08% ER\n2. Fidelity: .12% ER\n3. Schwab: .08% ER\n\nWhen talking about fees, it's important to keep things in perspective. The 2022 annual cap (not including for catch-up contributions) for tax-advantaged space for most Americans is $26.5K ($20.5K for 401K + $6K for IRA). A TDF that carries an ER of .20% equates to $53 in annual fees if you maximize the contribution to your tax-advantaged account (obviously less if you're not contributing $26.5K annually). In most cases, the ER difference between individual funds and a TDF is far less, but I'm using that figure as an example in what I would consider to be a \"low-fee\" TDF (.20% or less).\n\nFor someone who is not considering a TDF as a result of the fees are too high, can they honestly suggest that they can't shave $5/mo out of their annual budget? Someone who is not contributing the annual max of their tax-advantaged account would be far better served figuring out a way to get an additional $5/mo into said accounts than worried about the fee difference.\n\nEven if you're able to recreate the TDF asset allocation for cheaper with individual funds, human error / emotion in the asset allocation and rebalancing could completely wipe away any savings in fees you have. These funds take care of everything for you. The difference in fees between Vanguard TDF and their Mutual Fund equivalents is about .01-.02%, which is about $5/year.\n\n**Investing In Bonds Too Early**\n\nFor many people, a TDF is a bad idea because it includes bonds / fixed income too early in your investment horizon.\n\nAccording to [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/education/model-portfolio-allocation), the difference between historical returns of a 100% equities portfolio and an 80/20 portfolio is 1.2% annual. Extrapolating that to a 90/10 portfolio, we're talking about a .6% difference. Using the same math as before with the $26.5K annual tax-advantaged cap, we're talking about a difference of $160. Can someone who isn't maximizing their tax-advantaged space really say there is no way to cut out $15/mo out of their annual budget? Even someone maximizing their tax-advantaged space would be better off figuring out how to get $15/mo into their taxable account than worrying about the 10% bond allocation.\n\nThis doesn't even include the psychological impact of having bonds in the portfolio to dampen market volatility (the worst drawdown for an 80/20 portfolio was 35% vs 43% for 100% equities). Having one fund that you invest all your money into and don't think about the performance of the individual assets can reduce your ability to tinker in a panic situation (rebalancing between asset classes is handled for you).\n\n**Too Much International Equity Allocation**\n\nThe majority of reputable TDFs are going to be weighed along the lines of global market cap weight (e.g., 55-65% US / 35-45% ex-US). For some people, this is too much ex-US exposure.\n\nThis all goes back to the US / ex-US argument, but the irony here is a lot of people often advocate for total market funds from the same companies who offer TDFs. They trust that company to make a US or ex-US \"total market\" fund by market cap, but don't trust them to allocate between the two globally?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TDFs Aren't Perfect**\n\nThis is not to say that TDFs are what everyone should invest in.\n\nTDFs have flaws:\n\n1. Fees: TDFs (or any AIO / fund-of-funds) are going to be more expensive than the funds that it is comprised of. Actively-managed TDFs are expensive (same as actively-managed Mutual Funds / ETFs), and are not ideal. In a situation where the TDF options are high-fee, going with individual funds is probably preferred (you can always utilize the \"portfolio as a whole\" method and use IRA / taxable space to develop your own total asset allocation).\n2. At some point in your investing career, your portfolio balance (and complexity), annual contributions, and experience can put you in a situation where you may be able to manage the funds DIY and come out ahead. This is especially true for when withdrawing funds from your portfolio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, assuming you have access to a low-fee (.20% ER or lower) TDF in your tax-advantaged accounts, until you are maximizing your contributions and contributing a significant amount to your taxable account, you are likely better off focusing on your savings rate vs the fund that you are investing in; let professionals handle the asset allocation for you, and you just focus on getting more money in. You can always switch out from the TDF fund at a later date, but you can't go back and contribute to your tax-advantaged accounts for prior years.\n\nAt some point, if you decide your experience / situation justifies going with individual funds, by all means, go for it, but be aware that just because you can do better than a TDF, that doesn't mean that you will.",

Came into $440k as a result of a car accident settlement and I'm not sure what to do with that sum of money. My current plan was simply to keep $40k as cash and invest the other 400k over a 24 month period, 80% in fidelity zero total market index fund (FZROX) and 20% in fidelity zero international index fund (FZILX). At such a young age I'm just trying to keep things simple and cheap. Also when I start working in a year I will open a roth ira and have a 401k through my company. Any thoughts on this? Any suggestions or help or insights from anyone with some experience would be a huge help. Thanks!",

Learned a lot there, but the biggest thing I will always remember is that I should never try to go up against those firms. Unless you have inside information, you will NEVER have as much information at your fingertips as they do. When I left, this place had quite a bit, beyond the obvious large number of traders:\n\n* A five digit number of servers, many of which are constantly ingesting market data and determining where opportunities can be found\n\n* Hundreds of developers and other technologists, whose job is to create programs to understand the market data feeds and present the best opportunities for traders as well as instant evaluations for things like risk. When I say instant, I mean their processing time was measured in microseconds when I started there and nanoseconds when I left. \n\n* Multiple research teams who would be diving deep into SEC filings and reviewing other news for quick analysis of what that meant for that company and how other companies would be affected\n\n* Dozens of quantitative analysts (\"quants\"), most of whom had PhDs and would be developing trading models in tandem with the traders at the firm\n\nIn short, if you think you've got a soon-to-be \"hot stock\" that nobody knows about yet, odds are others not only do, they've evaluated it and determined the risk/reward ratio is not optimal. You may get lucky, but odds are you will lose out more often than you will win.\n\nThis is why I just do the 3 fund approach with a \"set it and forget it\" mentality.

Made a throwaway account because i\u2019d like to stay anonymous.\n\nSo I have received a windfall of $5M about 1 year ago (I\u2019m 31 years old right now). Haven\u2019t touched the money for a year, so I could research what to do with it.\n\n**Conclusion of my research**: low fee broad-market index fund (for stocks and bonds).\n\nBased on ERN\u2019s research ([https://earlyretirementnow.com/safe-withdrawal-rate-series/](https://earlyretirementnow.com/safe-withdrawal-rate-series/)) I decided to go with a SWR of 3% in up markets and trim it down to 2.5% on down years (to lower sequence risk). Also, during a downturn I will withdraw from the bond allocation instead of equities (this will give me 10+ years of runtime before I have to sell equities). Will rebalance accordingly of course.\n\nAlso important to mention: I have a paid off house that is big enough for starting a family later on the road.\n\nBecause I live in Europe, most standard index funds are not available. I\u2019ve chosen the following index funds:\n\n\\-EQUITIES = **VWCE** (Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF USD Acc) (ISIN: IE00BK5BQT80)\n\n\\-BONDS = **DBZB** (Xtrackers II Glbal Governmnt Bnd UCITS ETF 1C HEUR) (ISIN: LU0378818131)\n\n**VWCE** because it\u2019s accumulating and that gives me tax benefits. **DBZB** consist of globally diversified treasuries only because corporate bonds can be correlated with equities.\n\nBased on my research I\u2019m pretty sure my choice of index funds and SWR is solid. However, i\u2019m not sure about the allocation. I was thinking of **70/30** or **60/40** or maybe even **50/50** (because some say why keep playing if you already won ?). All three the allocation have a 100% succes rate when using a 3% SWR according to ERN\u2019s research. However, this is based on past performance.\n\nAlso to keep in mind: as the title says, at the moment I don\u2019t have any income and i\u2019m working on a side business of which I hope one day will give me some income. So for now I can be considered \u201cretired\u201d.\n\nThanks a lot!",

How is this possible you may ask? Doesnt that mean you are keeping money out of the market? That is timing the market! Booooo! Booooo!\n\nWell the answer is simple. I have been keeping my lump sum into the market exactly the same as I always keep it. I havent changed my 401k contribution, my HSA contribution, or my weekly taxable brokerage contribution. Instead what I am doing is adjusting the 50/30/20 formula. Which is 50% on needs 30% on wants and 20% on savings. I have tweaked this to minimize my wants by minimizing my purchases and taking that extra money and dumping it into the market. I am going out to eat to dinner less than I usually would and spending less of my money on frivolous products. That TV I wanted can wait a few more months. I cannot and wont do this forever of course but while the market is down it is always smart to take advantage of it. \n\nThat is how you buy the dip in the Bogle way. There is no need to get snarky with someone for keeping their money on the sidelines or keeping dry powder. This is not a cult where we have to ostracize people for \"violating the rules\", it is simply some guidelines from a smart man about how to easily make enough money for retirement.

It's simple and efficient, and looking at historical returns, it's a good strategy.\n\nBut as we all know, past performance doesn't guarantee future performance. Still people in subs like this one here preach to just keep DCAing and to not time the market. Whatever someone asks or suggests, the cult-like response is always: I just keep buying.\n\nI am wondering where you take the confidence from that this approach will continue to work. IMHO it only works under the assumption that in the long run the underlying index (ie. the underlying economy) will keep growing. If you DCA into an S&amp;P500 fund, you're making a bet that the US economy will keep growing in the long run. If you DCA into a Vanguard All World fund you're betting that the world economy will keep growing in the long run.\n\nBut in order for that to be the case, there needs to be growth of the companies that make up those economies. Such growth can only be achieved by increasing revenues or decreasing costs (or both); increasing revenues can be achieved by selling more for the same price, and/or selling at higher prices, and/or selling new/additional products. And my question is where that growth shall come from?\n\n\\- In the past, our domestic societies kept growing and were technologically underdeveloped, so there was already growth opportunity domestically. You didn't have to look abroad necessarily. Today, our domestic populations are aging and are highly developed.\n\n\\- In the past, globalization enabled us to both reduce costs, as well as to sell more, by going abroad with our products and productions. Today, we are living in a world that looks to de-globalise into blocks of free western democracies on the one hand and authoritarian regimes on the other hand. Future population growth will not be in our block, but in countries that are or are friendly with authoritarian regimes, and those are also the countries that are underdeveloped.\n\nSo I am wondering where that future growth shall come from that would be required to justify to keep DCAing, assuming that the world continues on the current path. For DCAing to be successful, something has to give and I am wondering what that is.",

The question she had was why she was hit with double her normal tax bill this year. Her tax bill was so unexpectedly high that she had to sell stock to pay it, which of course will incur even more taxes.\n\nIt turned out she was heavily invested (\\~$1.4mil) in actively managed mutual funds with a moderately high expense ratio (.38-.52%) and high portfolio turnover (\\~25%), in a taxable account. On top of this she is paying an advisory fee that adds up to about $20k per year, and, most concerning, these funds are doing noticeably worse than the S&amp;P500.\n\nThe main culprit lay in her capital gains distributions, which by itself was approx $120,000. This is different from the capital gains you have when you sell stock in your portfolio - distributions are generated by mutual funds when they sell stocks within the mutual fund. This is less of an issue for passive index funds, but for active funds it can result in what we saw in my mom's 1099: a capital gains distribution that can vary wildly from year to year depending on what the fund's managers decide to buy and sell. You have no control over this, and you get hit with the tax bill. You don't even get free money like dividends when this happens. It's literally just Wall Street fat cats making deals and passing the tax bill on to you. \n\nDo the math: 15% long term capital gains tax rate on $120k means she had to pay $18,000 in taxes on JUST the distributions, not even including any other sources of income. The real thorn in the side is that these distributions added nothing to her checking account - it was set to auto-reinvest, so she is paying $18,000 to reinvest in crappy active mutual funds THAT ARE UNDERPERFORMING THE S&amp;P500!!! \n\nLesson learned: Don't put mutual funds in a taxable account, especially active ones, especially ones with high turnover (which results in high distributions). There is a good reason Vanguard developed a proprietary way of hiding distributions in their mutual funds.",

I was able to work 2 jobs some semesters and pretty worked all the last 2 years of undergrad, which coupled with living for free at home, was super helpful with my savings goals.\n\nWhen I graduated and was looking to move out, I decided to consolidate my accounts and make sure I had a clear view of my networth and from Day 1 of my career I have been investing anywhere from 15% to 27% of my income every month, watching it grow a ton since getting my first and then my 2nd big boy job.\n\nHere is my overall networth growth for the last 2 years, starting from about 18k when I opened this account to now about 102k.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ar632nvewwd91.png?width=955&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b84f527f5b16fb9f7ce85fce430ac1539661f66c\n\nHere is the general mix of my portfolio\n\nCash: 23k (mix of checking account , short terms savings, and emergency fund)401k: \\~19k (this is just for my current job which I have not been at very long)\n\nRoth IRA: 41k (a chunk of this is from a ROTH 401k rollover from my first job)\n\nTaxable Brokerage: 15k (about 2k of this are individual stocks my first job gave me as compensation)\n\nHSA: 3k\n\nWhen I started I had very clear headed people I followed online that spoke of passive investing as a way to get rich and nowadays it seems like the financial media is chock full of influencers using \\*\\*way\\*\\* too many buzzwords and over gamifying investing, which is not and has never been my style.\n\nI think this just goes to show that following the bogleheads' method is the way to go.\n\nI hope this posts shows someone out there, younger or older, that investing steadily and keeping track of how much you save can be seriously fruitful in the long run.\n\nI love some good tips so if anyone can maybe see where I should be doing better please let me know!",

I created a stupidly complex estate with a dozen banks in various countries where I also had to manage overdrafts and currencies. Then income tax in each countries, etc. All that on top of a demanding fulltime job.\n\nOverall, I was performing well (above market) which is probably what \"convinced\" me to keep going. But wellbeing cost was high and the reward little in regards to the time taken away from family and friends. I even lost weight due to the stress and lack of sleep.\n\nLast christmas, my wife helped me accept that I was burning out. I sold everything brutally on the next day (including real estate which took a few months to close).\n\nFor the past 7 months, I DCAed daily (roughly 1%) all back into 1 unique ETF (Vanguard Life Strategy 80/20) and I'm finally done as of last week! I also invested in REITs (no cash, 100% fixed rate mortgage). I now have a simple and passive portfolio (in 1 unique bank).\nAll I need is to continue DCA monthly on paycheck day. I also took the opportunity to simplify and automate all our personal finances (bills, credit cards, subscriptions, etc) which feels really good too.\n\nOnce again, I want to thank this community for helping me realise that a simple boglehead portfolio will not only enable you to reach you FIRE goal, but most importantly it will also give you freedom and time back for what matters in life...",

        "selftext": "I'm 32 years old, single, no kids. The biggest goal that I'm working on is to have the option to be able to retire sometime in the next 10-15 years. I could obviously choose to work longer since I'll only be 42-47, but it feels like complete early retirement, going to something part-time, or changing jobs to something that's more rewarding/impactful than my current job but for less money is possible based on what I currently have saved and what I'm putting away each month when I use compound interest calculators and project out the next few years. My goal is to reach $1-$1.25M and maintain a real-spending level of \\~$45,000 (4% SWR). I make around $100K after-tax now so I'm saving \\~50% of my after-tax income. \n\nI have \\~$210K invested right now between my 401K, ROTH IRA, and brokerage account. See below for the portfolio breakdown and how much I'm contributing to all of them: \n\nBrokerage Account: $178K (72% S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV), 16% U.S. Mid Cap ETF (IJH), 7% U.S. Small Cap ETF (IJR), 5% International ETF (IXUS)). Auto-contributing $1,000 per week ($52K per year) based on this same allocation. This is my main account right now as you'll see from my relatively small 401K balance since my employer only matches the first 2% and we've failed the income discrimination test the last two years so I'm even getting that back at the end of each year. I'm also over the income limit to contribute to my ROTH IRA. This will be my main source of income in retirement (early and full).\n\nROTH IRA: $27K. (74% VTI, 18% VXUS, 5% IYR, 3% VNQI). Not contributing any more since I'm over the income limit. \n\n401K: $5K. 100% S&amp;P 500 Mutual Fund. Only putting 2% of my income to get the employer match but we've failed the income discrimination test the last two years so I'll probably be getting this back too.\n\n \n\nOverall, then, it's 92% U.S. stock ETFs, 6.5% international stock ETFs, and 1.5% Real Estate ETFs. If I were a 50-55 year old person with the goal of retiring at 65, I feel like the conventional wisdom would be to allocate my portfolio more towards bonds, but I just can't bring myself to do that. Should I do it anyway? Or go with a 2035-2040 Target date fund? I feel like mentally I can withstand the downturns between now and then. I've DCA'ed all the way through the past three years including COVID and the last 6-8 months and never been tempted to sell anything or change my strategy so I have a high risk tolerance. If anything, I actually get excited when I see prices going down. \n\nI always assume 8% growth but when I saw the graph below that says that I could still reach $935K in 10 years at 4% returns, that got me thinking about reallocation and potentially being a little safer to avoid another 25-30% downturn right around the time I'm ready to think about early retirement. I know the Boglehead advice would also say that I'm too heavily allocated in the U.S. but what other advice would you have or what would you do in my situation? Is my portfolio too aggressive or stock-heavy?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vb916je0cke91.jpg?width=668&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34465a958514b1a8c1dada5aa03cea49c0fcbc2d",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nThere's that quote from Charlie Munger about how you absolutely need to hustle for the first 100K and then afterwards you can take your foot off the gas a little.\n\nI'm in my late 20s. My retirement savings (401K, Roth IRA, HSA) hit 100K last November, since then between the market and my contributions I'm basically still there. I've been lucky, my parents helped me with college so I didn't have loans and was able to start off with a pretty good savings rate, 19% when I started working. I've had raises and such since, I'm now at a 24% retirement savings rate, and I save 10% on top of that through ESPP that I immediately cash out and put into a savings account/taxable. My Roth and HSA are maxed out, my 401K is not. My employer also matches 5% for my 401K.\n\nSome stuff has happened where I'm rethinking a bit. I don't regret saving this much except maybe I wish I had taken a few more vacations and said yes to some experiences that I said no to. Also other than the ESPP money, I don't really have down payment savings or anything.\n\nThey say you should save 15-20% for retirement and I'm doing that, you should start early and fortunately I was able to do that, and that the first 100K is the hardest and I'm there. I guess I just want someone smart and experienced to look at my situation and tell me \"yes, you can cut your 401K contributions by up to 4%\" or whether that is a bad idea. All the flowcharts say I should keep going til I'm maxing my 401K. However everything else says save 15-20%, and I'm kind of bummed about some of the things I didn't get to do.\n\nCan someone older or wiser than me tell me whether they think I'm at the \"take your foot off the gas\" stage yet, or if I should wait a while longer? Thank you!",

If it's a big windfall, you might not be used to P/L numbers so big and a big drawdown could effect you quite severely such that you even get scared off investing.\n\nYou can refer to the table above, but as an example of how to read it:\n\nIn the worst 1% of times to invest your windfall, a lump sum would have yielded a 35.9% loss on principle whereas for a 12 month DCA, this blow is softened to a 24.6% loss. Is this worth the average under performance? That's entirely up to you to decide.\n\nFor me personally, I don't know if the 6 month DCA period makes much sense because a 33.5% drawdown and 35.9% drawdown feel like they would hurt just about the same.",

        "title": "Why international stocks?",
        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio/](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio/)\n\n \n\nAt global market weights, U.S. stocks only comprise about half of the  global stock market. International stocks don\u2019t move in perfect  lockstep with U.S. stocks, offering a diversification benefit. If U.S.  stocks are declining, international stocks may be doing well, and vice  versa.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, chances are you\u2019re in the U.S. You  also probably overweight \u2013 or only have exposure to \u2013 U.S. stocks. This  is called *home country bias*. The U.S. is one single country out  of many in the world. By solely investing in one country\u2019s stocks, the  portfolio becomes dangerously exposed to the potential detrimental  impact of that country\u2019s political and economic risks. If you are  employed in the U.S., it\u2019s likely that your human capital is highly  correlated with the latter. Holding stocks globally diversifies these  risks and thus mitigates their potential impact.\n\nNo single  country\u2019s stock market consistently outperforms all the others in the  world. If one did, that outperformance would also lead to relative  overvaluation and a subsequent reversal. [Meb Faber](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/ivy-portfolio/) found that if you look at the past 70 years, the U.S. stock market has outperformed foreign stocks by 1% per year, but ***all*** of that outperformance has come *after* 2009.\n\nExcluding  stocks outside the U.S. means you\u2019re missing out on leading companies  that happen to be based elsewhere. Similarly, there have been periods  where a global portfolio outperformed a U.S. portfolio. During the  period 1970 to 2008, an equity portfolio of 80% U.S. stocks and 20%  international stocks had higher general\u00a0*and*\u00a0risk-adjusted  returns than a 100% U.S. stock portfolio. Specifically, international  stocks outperformed the U.S. in the years 1986-1988, 1993, 1999,  2002-2007, 2012, and 2017.\n\nEmerging Markets and international  small cap stocks have crushed the U.S. market historically, for example,  as they\u2019re considered riskier, and investors are compensated for that  greater risk. And this is just talking about performance. The volatility  and risk reduction benefits are another conversation entirely, which is  of huge significance for a retiree.\n\nNotice how U.S. or international outperformance tends to be cyclical:\n\nIf I were writing this in 2010 (or 1990, or 1980), we\u2019d be talking  about how a global portfolio beat a U.S. portfolio the previous decade.  The important takeaway is that it\u2019s impossible to know when the  performance pendulum will swing and for how long, much less how those  time periods would match up with your personal time horizon and  retirement date.\n\nMoreover, U.S. stocks\u2019 outperformance on average over the past half-century or so [has simply been due to increasing price multiples](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/The-Long-Run-Is-Lying-to-You), *not* an  improvement in business fundamentals. That is, U.S. companies did not  generate more profit than international companies; their stocks just got  more expensive. And remember what we know about expensiveness: cheap  stocks have greater expected returns and expensive stocks have lower  expected returns.\n\nFor U.S. investors, diversifying globally in  stocks is also a way to diversify currency risk and to hedge against a  weakening U.S. dollar, which has been gradually declining for decades.  International stocks tend to outperform U.S. stocks during periods when  the value of the U.S. dollar declines sharply, and U.S. stocks tend to  outperform international stocks during periods when the value of the  U.S. dollar rises. Just like with the stock market, it is impossible to  predict which way a particular currency will move next.\n\n[Dalio and Bridgewater](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/all-weather-portfolio/)  maintain that global diversification in equities is going to become  increasingly important given the geopolitical climate, trade and capital  dynamics, and differences in monetary policy. They suggest that it is  now even less prudent to assume a preconceived bet that any single  country will be the clear winner in terms of stock market returns.\n\nIn short, geographic diversification in equities has huge potential upside and little downside for investors.\n\n Bogleheads 3 Fund Portfolio \u2013 Choosing Assets and ETFs\n\nTaylor Larimore, considered \u201cKing of the Bogleheads,\u201d and co-author of [*The Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to Investing*](https://amzn.to/2Yoe6RP) and [*The Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to the Three-Fund Portfolio*](https://amzn.to/2zI5uep), succinctly summarizes the Bogleheads 3 Fund Portfolio\u2019s benefits as follows:\n\n* Diversification.

It is obviously quite simple to figure out how to max your ROTH IRA at only 6k per year which I am doing but I am unsure how to go about maxing out my 401k. I currently have my contributions set to 10% but if I wanted to make it higher to try and reach the 2022 limit of 20,500, how would I know what percentage contributions to change it to? I don't want to accidentally go over it either.\n\nEdit: hit post too early whoops.\n\nMy idea was to take 20,500, divide by 12 months so 1,708.3 per month. Divide that value by 4 (I am paid weekly), so 427.08 per paycheck. and find that percentage of my paycheck based on my gross that I get each check. Is that how it would be done?\n\nEdit: more math\n\nOr I guess you could just do 20,500 divided by 52 weeks a year so 394, and then find that percentage of my gross pay per paycheck as well.",

        "selftext": "Posted a comment about this on another thread, but I wanted to share it more broadly.\n\nFOMO, or the \"fear of missing out\", is an inevitable experience when investing. It seems like everyone has a story. Here are a few examples:\n\n* My buddy told me about Bitcoin all the way back in 2011 and I almost invested.\n* I sold the equity I got from work and the stock tripled right afterwards.\n* I saw the memes about GameStop before the stock took off, I could have been a millionaire.\n\nThese experiences can cause significant emotional pain. Feelings of regret, embarrassment, even depression, over what could have been, or almost was.\n\nThe truth is that everyone who invests is in the same boat. Whether you have a story like this or not. We all could have theoretically put all our available cash in Bitcoin in 2011. That doesn't mean it would have been a smart move. \n\nThe trick is to view risky investments like a lottery. Do some people win life changing amounts of money playing the lottery? Yes. Do most people? No. Should you invest in lottery tickets? No.\n\nAnytime you have investment FOMO, put it in the same category as \"I wish I won the lottery that time\". Fun to fantasize about, but nothing to feel ashamed by. Most of us didn't win the lottery. You're not alone, and you shouldn't regret it.",

They invest their personal savings into index funds and call it a day. \n\nFrom what I can gather, this is because they KNOW that, without the information, equipment, and tools they have at work, they don\u2019t have a mathematical edge on the market. \n\nThese are people who excel at game theory, statistics, and literally don\u2019t open trades unless they pretty much know they\u2019ll profit. They don\u2019t take \u201crisks,\u201d they make high probability bets.  Bets that they usually win. \n\nBut they can\u2019t make those bets at home without their work resources. So they don\u2019t. They make too much money to risk losing any of it. When you couple that with the strict rules the SEC puts in place regarding insider trading, it\u2019s just easier and smarter for them to buy index funds. \n\nSo yeah - Bogleheads got it right. Unless you have an edge, just let the market lift you up.",

But, I'm not seeing that when I run the numbers on my own.\n\nFor instance: VGSH (Vanguard short term treasury index fund)  \nAverage maturity: 1.9 years\n\nBut, if I chart it out in [this simulator](https://dqydj.com/etf-return-calculator/), which factors in reinvesting the dividends along the way, it's still showing an annual loss of 2.6%. What am I missing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fkyy9fppofs91.png?width=1472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66f27a285e8d2e652ff75d91dc9c6bcba08ebd90",

        "selftext": "# Investing Amid Low Expected Returns by Antti Ilmanen (2022)\n\n-\tYou have 3 options for dealing with the lower expected returns (2022)\n  - Take more risk\n  - Ignore it and accept the lower expected returns. Don\u2019t \u201cGet Cute\u201d and just ride it out (The Jack Bogle approach)\n  - Find and incorporate other sources of expected return (i.e., build a better portfolio)\n    - Antti is using a combination of all 3\n-\tIt is easy to back test a strategy and examine the painful periods and say \u201cI would stick with my strategy during that time\u201d Much harder in real life\u2026.\n  - You need the best strategy you can stick with, not an even better in theory strategy that you can\u2019t\n-\tLower asset yields and richer asset prices have brought forward future returns\n-\tMost assets are expensive compared to their history\n-\tFew investors have had the serenity to accept low prospective returns. Most hard choices have been delayed. Reaching for yield only helps so far\n  - Focus on what you can control as an investor\n  - Discipline, Humility, and Patience are key\n\n\u201cGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,\n\nThe courage to change the things I can,\n\nAnd the wisdom to know the difference.\u201d\n\n-\tLower bond yields and higher asset prices point toward low expected returns\n  - Most investors are not ready to accept this. Their expectations, plans, and spending haven\u2019t changed\n    - Many follow a \u201crear-view mirror\u201d approach and are likely to be disappointed\n-\tOutcome bias refers to the tendency to equate the quality of a decision with the quality of the outcome. Few investors can accept an extended period of disappointing performance.\n  - Good investments can go through bad periods (Decades)\n-\tAntti Investment Beliefs\n  - Diversification over concentration\n  - Believe more in style premia than illiquidity\n  - Prefer portfolio perspective (whole) over narrow framing (individual). That means what does this investment do to the whole portfolio, not just how it behaves alone: so top down rather than bottom-up approach\n  - Long term diversification over bold tactical timing\n  - Hold portfolios that are resilient across many different macro scenarios instead of portfolios that perform well when my investment views turn out to be right\n  - Survival comes first in risk management\n  - Probabilistic thinking over stories. Stories tend to anchor your ideas to one view\n  - In Summary, he favors humble forecasts and bold diversification\n-\tRearview-mirror expectations may lull investors into complacency\n-\tLow expected returns can materialize either through \u201cslow pain\u201d or \u201cfast pain\u201d\n-\tWe have been \u201cBorrowing returns from the future\u201d by bringing future returns forward\n-\tIn a \u201cSlow Pain\u201d scenario investor will clip low or even non-existent coupons for decades and no longer benefit from the tailwinds of ever richer asset valuations\n-\tIn a \u201cFast Pain\u201d scenario we will see mean revision to historically more normal (higher) bond yields and (lower) risky asset multiples. Implying speedy loss followed by more fair returns going forward\n-\tThe conventional wisdom on decadal return patterns is contrarian: a bullish decade tends to follow a bearish one, and so on.\n-\tTactical contrarian changes can make sense if you are patient. (Shifting away from higher valuation areas to lower valuations areas)\n-\tHe estimates that the low expected return challenge requires an almost doubling of the saving needed for a given retirement income target\n  - At a 5.5% real return, a person targeting a 75% replacement rate would need to save 8%.\n    - If your real return drops 2% to 3.5% real return, then you would need 15% savings rate.\n    - And if you wanted a greater than 50/50 chance of reaching your target retirement, then you would need 20% savings\n      - This also poses a challenge for the popular 4% withdraw rate if your investment returns are sustainably lower\n-\tNothing is new\n  - The Dutch investors in the 1600-1700s responded to lower government bond yields by increasing their AA to riskier assets, notably real estate\n  - In London in the 1850\u2019s, the low yields led insurers to change from government bonds to railroad bonds yielding 50-150 more basis points but at a much higher default risk\n    - Long periods of falling interest rates tended to compel institutions to bet their way out of potential unprofitability by increasing investment risk rather than locking in a loss\n  - What are investors doing currently?\n    - More equity like risk taking\n    - More illiquid private assets\n    - More factor-based investing\n      - You are not seeing as much active management and market timing strategies as in the past to overcome the lower returns\n  - All investors cannot simultaneously increase their equity exposures. Someone needs to take the other side. More generally, we cannot collectively hide from the low expected returns. We need the \u201cSerenity to accept what cannot be changed\u201d and consider changing our spending or saving plans and not just our risk-taking plans.\n-\tRiskless Cash (T- Bills) Return \u2013 This is the anchor to all investment returns\n  - A couple decades ago, the normal \u201cCash\u201d rate was 4% with an expected inflation of 2-3% yielding a real return of 1-2%. Now 0% is normal.\n    - Some countries even have a negative real interest rate\n      - Over time, the author thinks the riskless cash return should normalize (1-2% real)\n-\tThe story of inflation is one of near 0 net inflation over centuries where bouts of high inflation (often during war) were offset by bouts of deflation. The last century has seen much higher inflation and more persistent following the end of the gold standard and the introduction of a fiat (paper) standard in 1971.\n  - Hyperinflations are a rare event, especially in developed economies\n-\tEquity Risk Premium\n  - Historical equity market performance in excess of T-Bills or Bonds\n  - From 1900-2020, Global equities have returned 9.7% with an equity risk premium of 6.7% over US T-Bills and 4.3% over US Bonds\n    - Equity investing is hardly riskless though. Major equity indexes have had volatility between 16-20% and EM even higher at 23%.\n    - The longest negative real return in the US was 16 years. Germany was 55 years, Japan 51 years and the UK 22 years\n-\tClassic Dividend Discount Method (DDM)\n  - Expected Real Return = Dividend Yield + Growth in earnings per share (EPS) or dividend per share (DPS) + Expected change in valuation multiples\n    - EPS or DPS growth has averaged 1.5%\n-\tGordon Equation \u201cIncome plus Growth\u201d (Assumes constant payout ratio, growth rate, and number of shares (no buybacks or issues)\n  - Expected Real Return = Dividend Yield + Growth\n    - Growth - He assumes the long-run real growth of EPS or DPS to be 1.5% based on more than a century of US data.\n      - If you want to assume 2% due to share buybacks, that is ok too but won\u2019t change the picture much\n-\tSurprisingly, Fast (GDP) growing economies have not delivered higher equity returns\n  - Dimson-Marsh-Staunton found across countries a negative correlation between long term average GDP growth and equity market returns over a century. Other studies have found a negative to zero correlation over shorter time frames.\n    - However, long-term DPS growth and equity market returns are positively correlated\n-\tDDM estimate from Mid 2021 Outlook (US Equities)\n  - 3.2% real return = 1.7% (Dividend Yield) +1.5% (Dividend Growth Rate) + 0% Valuation Change\n    - If you add 2.3% for expected inflation then you have a nominal total return of 5.5%\n      - This estimate assumes no changes in P/E so if we lower the P/E (Valuation Change) then the return would be worse\n      - The Cape 10 in 2010 was 20. The Cape 10 in 2020 was 40. The US market returned 14% per year during the decade. 7% of the 14% (1/2) return was due to the increase in valuations.\n  - Outside the US, equity valuations tend to be lower and expected returns higher. The valuation gap between the US and the rest of the world is about as wide as it has ever been\n-\tBond Risk Premium\n  - Government bonds are safer than equities and considered free of default risk. But are subject to interest rate risk.\n    - The other premium for bonds is credit risk from corporate bonds\n  - The Bond Risk Premium or \u201cTerm Premium\u201d is the expected excess return of a long-term government bond over cash (T-Bill). It is the reward for duration extension and taking more interest rate risk\n    - For 1920-2020 (T-Bill vs 10-year Bond), the realized Bond risk premium was 1.8% per year.\n      - In 2021, Many advanced countries have even negative short rates and bond yields. Something we thought could not happen due to paper money arbitrage\n    - Bond yields tend to rise amid higher inflation, faster economic growth, and tighter monetary policy, thereby causing capital losses to bonds\n  - Outlook for bonds\n    - Low yields point to low expected returns. But bonds still have a role in a portfolio\n-\tCommodity Futures\n  - Very good inflation hedge and excellent diversifier\n  - Neither stocks nor bonds like rising inflation\n    - The studies show a long run commodity premium over cash of 3-5%\n    - Diversification is very important in the commodity space so don\u2019t buy single commodities.\n      - The volatility of any single commodity can be 30% or higher. The volatility drag can bring the geometric return of the commodity to zero over longer times.\n      - Yet, a diversified portfolio of these commodities can earn 3% compound average return because of the lower volatility. Rebalancing Bonus\n    - Outlook for Commodity Futures\n      - 3% over cash for a diversified commodity portfolio\n-\tGold\n  - 0 real long-term return (matches inflation over long terms)\n  - No interest or dividend income (impossible to value)\n    - Is a safe haven against a variety of ills\n    - Inversely related to real interest rates\n-\tBroad commodity portfolios are useful because they can hedge different types of inflation\n  - Oil during energy driven cost-push inflation\n  - Industrial Metals during demand-pull inflation\n  - Precious Metals when central bank credibility is questioned\n-\tIlliquidity Premium\n  - Many investors tend to believe in the illiquid premium. Almost as much as the equity premium. Yet, a more careful analysis reveals a milder or no illiquidity premium\n  - A study was done between 1978 \u2013 2020 on the illiquid premium of real estate vs REIT\u2019s and the more liquid REITs had better returns than the illiquid real estate\n  - Private equity outperformed the S+P 500 index by 2-3% per year over 30+ years after fees.\n    - But after David Swenson of the Yale trust popularized private equity, their outperformance disappeared since 2006.\n    - It should not come as a surprise that growing popularity by institutional investors in private equity in the mid 2000\u2019s was followed by much slimmer or even zero edge over public equity\n    - The long run outperformance of private equity looks slimmer if it is compared to small value stocks\n  - Investors in the drawdown phase might consider adding PE to a portfolio, but this will come at the expense of expected returns. It can reduce the volatility in a portfolio but at the expense of returns. You shouldn\u2019t expect an illiquidity premium.\n-\tStyle Premia\n-\tFor years, academics and practitioners have tried to identify persistent systematic sources of return.\n-\tGenerally, within asset class correlation (Like Equities) across regions is high (+0.6 and up), while correlations across asset classes and styles tend to be low to even negative\n-\tSize Premium \u2013 First identified in 1981. It remains a staple in most academic and practitioner analysis, but recent studies show no size premium in the long run data\n  - Any size or microcap premium looks like an illiquidity premium and there is underwhelming evidence of an illiquidity premium\n  - The evidence on size premium is also limited on other asset classes\n-\tValue and other contrarian strategies\n  - Value premium might exist for both behavioral and risk-based explanations.\n    - Behavioral \u2013 Excessive extrapolation of growth trends and equating good companies with good investments irrespective of price\n    - Risk Based \u2013 Higher default or destress risk\n  - Value strategy has fared better outside the US than within the US and mostly better in small cap than in large cap\n  - When this book was written in 2020, the Value/Growth spread was as high as it has ever been.\n-\tMomentum\n  - Extrapolative strategies buy recent winners and sell recent losers\n    - Many assets exhibit performance persistence\n    - Value and Momentum are negatively correlated so they make great complements to each other\n    - The risks with momentum strategies are in sharp market turns and whipsawing trendless markets.\n    - US Retail investors tend to be anti-momentum\n-\tDefensive and Other Low Risk/Quality Strategies\n  - Take advantage of the fact that within most asset classes, \u201cboring\u201d assets have earned better risk adjusted returns than their speculative peers.\n  - Much of Warren Buffett long run returns in the market came not from his Value exposure, but his Quality exposure\n-\tAlpha\n  - Is the extra uncorrelated return achieved beyond any common systemic factors\n    - It is often used as a measure of manager skill\n  - Investors have increasingly shifted away from active to passive investing\n  - \u201cSamuelson\u2019s dictum\u201d refers to the conjecture that financial markets may be micro efficient (Difficult to capture Alpha) but macro inefficient (Markets can go crazy)\n    - There is some truth to this\n  - To sum it up, true Alpha is valuable, but elusive.\n    - It is also increasingly scarce if competition is higher and the pool of negative Alpha players is shrinking\n    - Any evidence of individual manager Alpha persistence is modest at best\n    - Do not assume your managers or your own active stock picking can achieve significant Alpha.\n-\tOverall, for most premia, it seems likely that both risk based and behavioral explanations matter\n  - Most investors capitulate from almost any factor after a few years of underperformance\n  - No Risk, No Premium\n    - It is precisely the painful times that will sustain the premium and prevent it from being arbitraged away\n  - Factors or strategies that tend to earn \u201cbad returns in bad times\u201d should offer a large long run return. But investors should be happy to hold some safe-haven strategies in their portfolio even if they offer much lower long run returns\n  - His answer to anyone concerned with crowding in a style premium (factor investing) is that growing popularity should show up in persistently richer factor valuations. If you are worried about crowding, check valuations in that factor as the best crowding indicator\n-\tPatience is a virtue in investing\n  - Investors tend to demand more performance consistency than is feasible in markets, often resulting in ill-timed capitulations\n  - It is easy to have conviction and patience when your strategy is working, real challenge is when investors face adversity\n    - Investors tend to care about what happened to their portfolios recently\n-\tDaniel Kahneman has a saying \u201cThe Law of Small Numbers\u201d \u2013 Investors tend to expect any long run edge to manifest itself within a short time. When outcomes fail to live up to the anticipated (but unrealistic) expectations, they deallocate.\n-\tSometimes though, investors are TOO patient. Sometimes it is right to capitulate.\n  - The \u201cdisposition effect\u201d implies that investors may hold on to losing investments for too long, because selling would involve realizing losses and admitting that the original decision was wrong\n-\tThe magic of diversification is frequently underutilized. Most investors have home country bias dominated by equity risk in the portfolio\n-\tDiversification originated by the Talmud over 2,000 years ago. \u2013 \u201cLet every man divide his money into 3 parts, and invest a 1/3 in land, 1/3 in business, and 1/3 let him keep in reserve.\u201d\n-\tDiversification can reduce volatility and increase portfolio returns\n-\tGlobal equity vs home bias\n  - Equity markets are highly correlated across markets so the benefit here is limited\n  - He found it puzzling that John Bogle and Warren Buffet endorsed home country bias investing\n  - The U.S market is often more popular after a strong decade\n    - Yet, both logic and empirics suggest that a globally diversified portfolio should provide better risk adjusted returns over the long run\n-\tRebalancing \u2013 refers to adjusting portfolio allocations back to target weights\n  - Can be done on a schedule, by large market moves, or at discretion\n  - Without rebalancing, portfolios would tend to drift toward a concentrated position in the highest returning and in theory highest risk asset class\n  - Systemic rebalancing might help enhance long run returns\n    - Lower variance drains (reduced volatility and boosts geometric return)\n    - Synchronization with reversal patterns in the market\n  - Can be done with any asset class, but it is most useful when allocating across liquid asset classes\n  - Rebalancing is defensively contrarian by selling past winners and buying past laggards to get back to target weights\n  - Tactical rebalancing is proactively contrarian by actually overweighting past laggards\n  - He likes the \u201coften by a little\u201d approach.\n    - Rebalance every quarter (3 months) \u00bc of the portfolio back to its target weights.\n  - Many investors talk diversification, but walk concentration. Their portfolios are dominated by one source of risk, equity.\n-\tCosts and Fees\n  - Trading costs and asset management fees dimmish investor performance.\n    - The goal should be to maximize net returns adjusted for risk, and not to just minimize costs or fees.\n    - We have seen a gradual but persistent shift from active investing to passive.\n      - But we have also seen higher inflows into hedge funds and illiquid private equity funds during this time too\n    - Virtually all fund type fees have declined over time, a trend that is expected to continue\n    - Cliff Asness Law \u2013 \u201cNo investment product is so good that high enough fees cannot make it a bad investment.\u201d\n-\tTactical timing strategies\n  - The benefits of strategic diversification often trump those from tactical timing\n  - Economist Paul Samuelson suggested that if you are tempted to do market timing (tactical timing), you can yield to the temptation, but cautiously: \u201cSin \u2013 but only a little.\u201d\n    - Zero market timing may not be right, but overconfident aggressive market timing is almost certainly wrong. There are no old market timers in the Forbes 400.\n  - Timing evidence points to humility with tactical forecasts\n  - Contrarian market timing did mildly beat buy and hold strategies over 120 years, but just not in our lifetime.\n    - Why?\n      - A bearish signal might have left investors on the sidelines during a multi-decade bull run\n      - Contrarian signals often come too early\n      - Contrarian strategies also face headwinds form long run trends, that is, structural changes in the markets.\n      - Investors have high expectations on the usefulness of market timing\n  - Key point \u2013 \u201cSin only a little\u201d if you are going to market time. Tactical timing should be done with humility and not hubris.\n-\tBad habits\n  - Focus on what you can control (process rather than results)\n  - Goyal-Ilmanen-Kabiller called the \u201cpremier bad habit\u201d \u2013 multiyear return chasing, based on impatience, overextrapolation, and emotions/sediment. Procyclic investing into strength and ill-timed capitulation. A good strategy is one you can stick with.\n  - Other bad habits\n    - Under saving\n    - Under diversification\n    - Overtrading\n    - Cycles of fear and greed\n    - Overextrapolation and underreaction\n    - Lottery preferences\n  - Many investors buy multiyear winner and sell multiyear laggards. This is due to our behavioral biases.\n    - Chasing winners over a few months may actually be profitable as financial markets tend to exhibit momentum (Momentum Factor)\n    - But evidence indicates though that at multi-year horizons, financial markets tend to exhibit more mean revision than continuation.\n  - Many investors\u2019 decisions are clearly performance chasing and often ill timed\n  - One year momentum and multiyear reversal patterns also are evident in other countries and asset classes\n  - Many investors lack patience when facing years of underperformance\n    - Strategies to improve patience\n      - Spend time evaluating the strategy/manager before investing and only select ones they have the faith and ability to stick with\n      - Understand other decision criteria besides past performance and develop an understanding of a reasonable ranges of outcomes\n      - Take a long view to judge performance\n  - Do not live beyond your means. Make sure to save enough\n  - Overextrapolation is behind the multiyear return chasing and excessive hire and fire activity of managers\n  - Moods, emotions, feelings, sentiment, are widely talked about behavioral pitfalls\n  - Anchoring can contribute to the underreaction effects\n  - Narrow framing is related to line item thinking at the expense of portfolio perspective. It leads to a focus on an investment\u2019s standalone gains/loss instead of its impact on the total wealth. Narrow framing contributes to under diversification (Home country bias, equity concentration, single stock exposure, overconfidence).\n  - Probability weighting and especially overweighting low-probability events leads to investor preference for lottery like positively skewed investments\n-\tGood Habits\n  - Try to cultivate discipline, patience, and probabilistic thinking\n    - Discipline helps against mood swings and emotions\n    - Evaluate investments broadly and rarely\n    - Recognize that we are drawn to stories but this can be damaging to your wealth\n  - Morgan Housel \u2013 \u201cSave like a pessimist, invest like an optimist\u201d\n  - It is especially important to save more in a low return world to reach any spending targets and some risk taking is a must when low cash rates are at the heart of the lower expected returns.\n-\tThe lower expected returns have many investors taking on more risk and not increasing savings or decreasing spending\n-\tA justifiable but difficult answer is for investors to hold a broadly similar portfolio as in normal times: stick to their long run strategies and beliefs, and accept that markets now offer less\n-\tHaving essentially borrowed returns from the future through multi-decade windfall gains, we are in for low returns for the next decade or longer. Weather that is slow pain or fast pain remains to be seen",

Bonds purchased by the deadline will have an Oct. 1 issue date.\n\nBonds purchased Saturday, Sunday, and Monday will be issued in November, and will have the rate announced by Treasury on Nov. 1\u2014next Tuesday, according to the website.\n\nI Bonds purchased this week will have the 9.6% rate for the first six months and the new rate, more than likely about 6.5%, for the following six months, *Barron\u2019s* estimates. Over the next year, the rate should be 8.2%\u2014the math: 9.6% plus 6.5% divided by two, plus compounding. Our estimate reflects compound interest. The estimated 8.2% rate compares with 4.6% on one-year Treasury bills.\n\nThe new expected rate reflects the change in the consumer price index from March through September. I bond interest adjusts every six months based on the trailing six-month CPI, which isn\u2019t seasonally adjusted.\n\nAn investor is limited to [$10,000 of purchases ](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/how-much-can-i-spend-own/)each calendar year and can buy another $5,000 annually on paper I bonds with the proceeds of federal tax refunds. And an individual can buy another $10,000 in I bonds through certain business partnerships.\n\nThe interest is added every six months to the face value of the bond rather than paid in cash to holders. This compounding eliminates reinvestment risk, or the need to reinvest semiannual interest payments.\n\nSomeone who buys $10,000 in I Bonds this week should get about $480 in interest in the next six months, which will be added to the value of the bonds, resulting in a holding worth around $10,480.\n\nAn individual needs to hold I Bonds for at least a year and redemptions within 5 years result in a three-month interest penalty. The maturity is 30 years.\n\nOne favorable feature is that interest on I bonds is exempt from state and local taxes as is the case with other Treasury obligations.\n\nThe record rate for the past six months has resulted in a record number of purchases. There were about $5 billion of I Bonds sold in May, a record monthly total.",

It seems to have excellent ratings via Morningstar and the like so I've not changed it (the other fund options aren't so great sadly -- if I could I'd use Vanguard's TDF but alas), but I was not aware til today that Fidelity charges you these administrative and record keeping fees.

        "selftext": "# Treasury Sold $3.4 Billion in I Bonds This Week as Investors Rushed to Get 9.62% Rate\n\nThe interest rate on inflation-adjusted I Bonds is expected to drop to around 6.47% starting Nov. 1\n\nOct. 28 is investors\u2019 last chance to buy I Bonds that earn a 9.62% interest rate. Yet a surge in demand for the inflation-adjusted bonds has overwhelmed the TreasuryDirect site and the Treasury Department [said it cannot guarantee orders will be completed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-investors-scramble-to-buy-i-bonds-treasurydirect-site-has-outages-11666817951?mod=article_inline) in time.\n\nMany investors managed to beat the clock and the tech issues. As of 4 p.m. ET, nearly 69,000 accounts had been created and more than $710 million in I Bonds purchased on Friday alone, Treasury said. That brings this week\u2019s I Bond sales to about $3.4 billion so far, Treasury said.\u00a0Five thousand new accounts were created per hour Friday, Treasury said. \n\nMany investors have reported running into difficulties accessing and logging on to the site.  If a customer receives a confirmation that their purchase has been made or completed by 11:59:59 p.m. ET on Oct. 28, then the payment will be processed, a spokesman said. The Treasury Department said Friday that it would be taking the TreasuryDirect account management system offline Saturday and Sunday for scheduled maintenance. \u201cThe maintenance period will\u00a0ensure TreasuryDirect is able to successfully process the unprecedented volume of I bond purchases made in the past 24 hours,\u201d Treasury said on its site.\u00a0Customers who complete an I Bond purchase before the scheduled maintenance begins will receive 9.62% for six months, Treasury said.\u00a0\n\n As the deadline to get the 9.62% rate approached this week, the government\u2019s [TreasuryDirect site](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/), the only place investors can directly purchase I Bonds, became one of the most visited federal websites, officials said, and has experienced intermittent outages for several days this week.\u00a0\n\nTreasuryDirect will reopen for account creation and purchases on Monday, Oct. 31.\u00a0 Beginning Monday, purchases will receive the rate that will be published on Tuesday, Nov. 1, Treasury said.",

Beta = volatility\n-\tAlpha \u2013 The excess return of an investment relative to the return of a benchmark index is the investment&amp;#39;s alpha\n  - 20% of active managers got positive alpha in the 90&amp;#39;s. That number is down to 2%\n  - Why \u2013 The market has become more efficient. It is harder to exploit. What were sources of &amp;quot;alpha&amp;quot; are gone, dramatically reducing the ability to generate alpha. The remaining competition is going to get better and better because the men and women left standing are more skillful than the people who were playing before.&amp;quot; 90% of trading is done by institutional investors that know what they are doing. And more money is chasing that shrinking pool of alpha that is available.\n  - Taking more risks in your portfolio (IE \u2013 Leverage) doesn&amp;#39;t increase your alpha.\n-\tActive management is a zero-sum game. For every winner, there must be a loser. And usually that loser is an individual investor. And more people are going toward passive management so there are less &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot; at the table to exploit\n-\tYou cannot rely on active managers to get you excess returns.

        "selftext": "the more I look on reddit, the more I believe most self-proclaimed Bogleheads are not very familiar with what John Bogle actually said. I get the impression people are taking advice from the reddit consensus, or from Taylor Larrimore's books which are very simplified compared to Bogle's books. it might be time for people to go back to the source on Bogle-related info. \n\na few months ago, I posted a reminder here that Bogle recommended a minimum 20% bond allocation for all investors (see the asset allocation chapters in *The Common Sense Book of Investing Advice*). yet I constantly see self-proclaimed Bogleheads saying 'you don't need bonds until you're older, or x-years from retirement'. \n\ncame across another example recently. In a 2014 interview (here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ra5POdsYg ) Bogle explained how he sold most of his stocks during the dot-com bubble that peaked in 2000. He had a 70-80% stocks allocation, and went down to 25-30% (3:40). Why? Because stocks had highly elevated Shiller price to earnings ratio of 40 (this is the '40 times earnings' Bogle mentions at about 3:00). Based on that high valuation, Bogle expected the market would be basically flat over the next decade, as higher p/e ratio equals worse stock returns and lower p/e ratio equals better returns as he explains in *Common Sense*. He also noted that stocks had historically low dividend yields of 1%, while investment grade bonds had 7% yields and were likely to perform better than stocks over the next decade (ca. 2000 to 2010)\n\nanyone who talks this way on reddit gets downvoted into oblivion by the Bogleheads. I've seen it happen. yet it's exactly in line with Bogle's principles as outlined in his books. \n\nin fact, bonds performed as well as stocks from 2000 to 2020, if not better! The New York Times reports the S&amp;P 500 averaged 5.4%/year during that period, while and investment grade bond index returned 5.2%/yr, and other types of bonds (treasuries, high-yield debt) had even better annual returns. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html",

I've read some of the other discussions on this sub about the ZERO funds, but they are pretty old and might no longer be accurate. \n\nThe way I see it, the only \"catch\" is that the Indexes which the zero funds track are not from a trusted third party, but proprietary to Fidelity (also a trusted org, of course, and the indexing method makes sense). Some also point out that the total market and total market international funds are not *quite* as diversified as the with-fee counterparts (2821 vs 4001 holdings for FZROX vs FSKAX) -- I was thinking that far down the order, the companies are a very tiny percent anyways.

        "selftext": "I've been following the BH forum for almost a decade and this sub for about 2 years, and I've never seen so many questions about bonds as this year. It's not surprising since the Fed rate hadn't been higher than 2.5% since 2008 and suddenly this year it shot up more than 400 basis points for the biggest annual increase in half a century. The dramatic rate increase also sent stock prices tumbling for the biggest correlated stock &amp; bond decline in most of our lifetimes. This was met with some new fixed-income enthusiasm for the increased yields, a lot of [shock at the loss of value of bond funds](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1114969/why-2022-has-been-such-a-terrible-year-for-bond-funds), and many questions about how bonds work. They are not nearly as simple as \"bonds = safety\", or even as simple as \"rates go up = bonds go down\" as many might have thought. So I decided to recap some of the information and links I remember reading or sharing dozens and dozens of times in 2022:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. \"Why did the value of my bond fund go down?\" seemed to be the question flooding the sub in the spring. Interest rate risk is a very real thing and it all ties back to your [bond fund's duration](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bonds:_advanced_topics#Duration): \"**The duration is approximately the amount by which the price of the bond will fall for every 1% rise in interest rates**.\" That is the explanation for why BND - with a duration of around 6 years - fell by nearly 18% as the Fed rates climbed over 3% higher in an effort to fight inflation. At the extremes, EDV with a super long 25-year duration fell more than -50%, whereas SGOV with a microscopic duration of about 5 weeks never lost value and will end the year up about 1.3%. As in all allocation decisions, **your holdings need to be calibrated to your risk tolerance, goals, and timeline**. But if your fund lost value, fear not - when rates increase, the loss of value of your bond fund is temporary but the new higher yields mean you will actually come out ahead IF YOU HOLD TO THE AVERAGE MATURITY.\n2. [I-bonds](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/i-bonds) became all the rage again at the end of last year as inflation soared to its highest points since the 1970's. These are a terrific place to park cash to keep it protected from inflation over the long term. They have a base interest rate (now more than zero!) plus an additional indexed rate to track the CPI - a rate that can never go negative. You can only buy $10,000 per person per year, but nothing in fixed income is beating them in 2021-22. They are great for an emergency fund, after you have accounted for the 1-year lockup period.\n3. Finding the current yield of a bond fund is not the simplest matter. Many folks asked something like - my high-yield savings account is paying 3% but I looked up BND on Yahoo and it says the yield is 2% so why I would ever buy BND? Not so fast. The generic yield stat that many finance sites report is a 12-month average which would go all the way back to the end of 2021 when yields were much lower. \"SEC yield\" is another backward-looking statistic that reports the average yield of the last 30 days. This makes it easy to compare different funds, but in an environment where rates are shooting up every month or two, that can't keep up with what to expect going forward. Generally, the best place to get a sense of a fund's expected yield going forward is to go to the fund page and look up the *average yield to maturity* which [for BND](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bnd) today is 4.5%. Even this isn't an accurate picture because bond funds are always in the process of cycling in new bonds, now at higher rates - a process which can take longer depending on the length of the duration of the fund. So in all likelihood, the yield of a total bond fund will keep increasing until it gets somewhere around the historical norms of 1-2% above the Fed funds rate.\n4. \"What bond fund should I hold\" came up again and again for folks trying to understand the differences between dozens of seemingly similar bond funds. I directed many people to [this excellent post by White Coat Investor](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/bond-funds/) which runs down many of the basic bond fund components like treasuries, corporates, and mortgages, not to mention TIPS. Bonds can serve three main purposes - income,  diversification, and capital preservation - and you need to decide which is most important to you in order to choose a fund. Some people like to follow the mantra of \"take your risk on the equity side\" and keep their bonds safe in short-term treasuries which are the best at preserving capital. The best diversifier from stocks is still long-term treasuries, but **NOT THIS YEAR**, as correlated declines rarely but occasionally do happen in high inflation cycles. The highest yields come from corporate bonds - [a favorite asset class of Jack Bogle's](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/718645/bogle-corporate-bonds-a-sensible-way-to-pick-up-yield) \\- and supposedly the \"fallen angels\" BBB-rated give you the best return on investment, although they are notably riskier and correlated with stocks. All told, a total bond fund with a mix of durations and types is still probably the best bet for the average investor *with a timeline of more than 6 years*. Money needed in a shorter timeline should probably be in shorter bonds or a bank HYSA.\n5. Speaking of HYSA's, the game was on to find the best rates, and yields seem to be going up week by week. Whether parking an emergency fund or saving for a house, people are flocking to [Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/best-high-yield-interests-savings-accounts/) to find the next obscure online bank they've never heard of to move their money to get the highest interest (now over 4%). Credit unions in particular often have some of the most impressive rates. But if you get tired of this game, maybe consider a T-bills fund like SGOV or BIL which holds the same 13-week treasuries where your bank is investing your savings (and hoping to generate a profit). These will typically trail only the very best HYSA rates by a few basis points for maybe a few weeks but will keep going up with interest rates so you don't have to move around. And floating rate notes (USFR, TFLO) can do this even better because their rate resets weekly and they have an even higher yield thanks to their 2-year maturity. Both of these options are US treasuries so they are not subject to ~~federal~~ state &amp; local income tax like bank savings. But beware, unlike bank savings accounts, you can only cash them out during market hours, they do still have interest rate risk, and their fees will offset their utility if/when rates get below 0.5% again.\n6. TIPS surprised some people by not doing particularly great in an inflationary environment from 2021-2022. They did better than nominal bonds, especially short-term TIPS in the early arrival of high inflation, but they are still bonds with interest rate sensitivity. VIPSX for example is down more than -10% on the year. The distinction I would make about them is that TIPS may help protect *your bonds* from inflation, but they don't protect *your portfolio* from inflation, and bonds are not the asset class you hold to deal with inflation in the first place. Stocks are the part of your portfolio that will handle inflation the best over the long term, especially REITs and small-cap value. If you are retired and want an allocation to something that goes UP when inflation hits, that is probably commodities - you can listen to Frank Vasquez of Risk Parity Radio explain that in an amusing rant against TIPS at the 5:15 mark [in this podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/risk-parity-radio/id1525099266?i=1000547296583).\n7. Finally, there has been a lot of discussion about whether one should hold individual bonds or CD's instead of a bond fund since you know with those you will get your principal back unlike bond funds which have dropped in value. It is true that these instruments will give you the most predictability, and that is especially useful for folks with low risk tolerance. But the idea that they don't lose value is actually something of an illusion. Most people who manage their own bond/CD ladder aren't marking to market their entire ladder every day so they don't see the spot price falling when interest rates rise the way you do with an ETF, but if they tried to sell the whole ladder on the secondary market it would certainly be worth less. [This blog post](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2022/11/owning-individual-bonds-vs-owning-a-bond-fund/) and [this study](https://www.northerntrust.com/japan/insights-research/2014/the-myth-of-holding-to-maturity) explain that holding individual bonds to maturity being safer is something of a myth.\n\nThose are some of my highlights from the year in bonds. Did I miss something or get something wrong? I'm curious to hear what specifically others may have learned about bonds in this crazy year.",

        "selftext": "Assuming you don\u2019t have any IRA Assets that you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to move into your employers 401K, you will save a lot of headache and reduce new threads on this subreddit in Novem 2023 - April 2024 if you simply Backdoor if you are anywhere close to where a surprise 10% raise and 20% bonus and 700 hours of Overtime could put you over the AGI limits for a full direct Roth contribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have noticed at least 4 threads in just the last few weeks on this sub. No call-outs or links, but to quote two of those threads:\n\n\" Between my wife and I (filing jointly) we were expecting to make around $195,000, but I recently got an unexpected bonus that could take our AGI over the Roth IRA limit of $204,000. \"\n\n\"  I work in commission based sales, and I honestly didn't expect to make this much. Was expecting around 115k-120k. I contributed 6k to a Roth IRA last January, so I'm in a position where I've already contributed, but don't qualify for the Roth due to making more than anticipated. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you Backdoor, you will spend 18 seconds more on TurboTax next March but several hours less time stressing about your income and the income limits for the next 12 months, plus time posting next year \u201chow can I reduce my 2023 income or Recharacterize my Roth\u201d. With a backdoor Roth contribution, you can put in $6000 on January 1 and not even remotely consider income limits for the next 364 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor anyone who has no traditional IRA assets, I see absolutely no reason to NOT backdoor your Roth. It takes about 12 seconds or less on Fidelity, and from the tutorials I have seen online I am guessing it's close to that on Vanguard as well. At Fido, you contribute the funds to your Brokerage account, wait a  few days for them to show as \"Available to Withdraw\", and then Transfer to your $0.00 trad IRA and then immediately transfer to your Roth IRA. The reason for the brokerage step is otherwise your funds get stuck in the Trad IRA for a few days, and then you will get interest credited to your core account / settlement fund inside the Trad IRA, which can add a bit of a headache with regards to having earnings to deal with.",

        "selftext": "First, let\u2019s dispense with the \u201cprior results do not predict the future\u201d arguments.  Agreed, but it cuts both ways, so those generalized and non-specific responses are less than helpful.  Instead, let\u2019s agree that something that has *always* happened is a safer bet than something that has *never* happened.  I use that as the bar for my observations, and I hope you will consider that bar for your comments.\n\nSecond, I have tried to find resources on the point below, but they miss the mark.  Most are right in pointing out how the three-fund portfolio is superior to many other options, but they are not on the point I am considering.  Maybe I missed a resource as this seems like it could be a FAQ.\n\nHere\u2019s my observation, tested with portfolio tools over various timeframes and assuming regular monthly contributions and annual rebalancing: The three-fund portfolio reduces risk and volatility, but time also attenuates risk and volatility.  (Zoom out on any graph and see how major market panics look like blips with sufficient hindsight.) *With time* (say 20 years), the three-fund portfolio has *always* produced an greatly inferior result relative to 100% US total equity market *during the accumulation phase*.   *With time*, it produces much lower returns without *any* reduction in risk (sharpe ratio, etc.).  Thus, *with time*, the three-fund portfolio is the wrong answer.   At least it *always* has been.\n\nThoughts are welcome on the above.  Even pointing out a specific index mix and a period of 20 years as a counterpoint for me to test is super helpful.  What am I missing, if anything?\n\nMy secondary hypothesis is that the regular contribution aspect benefits from the larger drawdowns in the US-stock-only portfolio, making that portfolio more attractive over the long term.  Related: annual rebalancing can often reduce returns.\n\nI am working through what this means for those with less than 20 years to retirement.   For those with 20+ years to retirement, it seems that the three-fund portfolio is not for you (assuming you don\u2019t act on panic during drawdowns and keep to the plan).\n\nPlease help me see the error of my ways, and restore my faith!",
