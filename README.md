# IS450 Project: Market Bites

Market Bites is a project focused on analyzing recent financial news and Reddit posts using various text mining techniques. It includes data processing, NLP model training (Topic Modelling, Sentiment Analysis, Information Extraction, Text Summarization), and a full-stack web application to present the findings.

The web application allows users to search for companies (e.g. Google, Tesla) and get bite-sized insights from real-time data.

**Deployed Application:** [market-bites.netlify.app](https://market-bites.netlify.app/)

## Project Structure

*   **/App**: Contains the source code for the frontend (Vue.js) and backend (Python/Flask) web application. See `App/README.md` for setup instructions.
*   **/Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks detailing the experiments and development of NLP models for:
    *   Data Processing
    *   Topic Modelling
    *   Sentiment Analysis
    *   Information Extraction
    *   Text Summarization
    *   OpenAI Labeling
*   **/Data**: Contains the raw and processed data used for analysis and model training.
*   **/outputs**: Stores outputs generated by the notebooks or application (e.g., models, results).
*   **/Documents**: Project-related documentation.

## Web Application Setup

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the web application, please refer to the `README.md` file located in the `/App` directory.
